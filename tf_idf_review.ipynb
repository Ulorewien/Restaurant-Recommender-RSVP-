      "[\"Had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who's was who's and forgot several items on an order.

Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco.

      "[\"Had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who's was who's and forgot several items on an order. I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back.\", 'Sat down over a half hour, only miso and drinks served. Waiting for actual food ordered or someone to cook it ....waiting ...', 'Not bad. Sushi roll was good but options were limited. Hibachi grill: i got steak...chef asked me 2x how i like mine-medium...Still ended up with well done. Rest of my group had chicken which all voiced lacked seasoning. \\n\\nBeware they DO NOT have a late happy hour 8-11 as advertised on their website. We asked the staff about it and they claimed 8-11 was for a different location. Their website nowhere indicates the happy hour is for a specific location nor does the website indicate they have multiple locations at all.', \"I'm very picky when it comes to Sushi. Quality of the fish and ingredients are very important but so is the chef, maybe the most important. Hiro San is absolutely amazing at what he does. His skills are hands down the best and he's also a really great human being to talk to. If you are in the Santa Barbara area looking for a great Sushi experience come here and sit in front of the master, you won't regret it.\", 'Even though the sushi masters are not actually Asian but they make good Sushi. The price is also cheap.', \"If I based my review only on my meal, I'd have to give it one star.  But everyone else in my party of 10 enjoyed their meal, and we had a great time.  I ordered the vegetarian meal, and it was the WORST veggie meal I've ever had :(  My meal came with soup and rice, just like everyone else, but when the others got their choice of meat I got a plateful of sliced red peppers.  That's all.  Sliced red peppers.  Uh,   how about some mushrooms or zuchini or squash or about a million other veggie options.  Fortunately, I'd had enough sake bombs not to get too upset about it!\", 'This is a favorite place for me and my friends. We love sitting at the bar and indulging on half price sushi for lunch and dinner. We love their beer selection, and the place is trendy and a lot of fun. I do not like the fact that they include gratuity on the bill, and sometimes the 50 percent off seems to be closer to 47 percent... Now, since the rolls are small, one ends up spending about as much money as one would at a place with a regular price on sushi, but one ends up getting more food and a bigger variety of rolls.', 'In my experience, the staff was a disappointment. We had 3 employees try to take our \"complicated\" order. We just wanted baked salmon with Avocado and cucumber. Which was just a simple customized order. While we were ordering our waitress didn\\'t have the power to take our order. She felt it was to complicated so she just walked away and pass us up to another waitress. In result this restaurant lacks communication and mannerisms. So I wouldn\\'t recommend this place. If your order is to complicated to them, they won\\'t take it. they\\'ll just pass you up to their manager.', 'Not worth the 50% off. I knew I had a bad feeling the second I walked in. The restaurant was a bit too hot for a sushi bar with fish sitting there behind the un-refrigerated glass all day. I should have listened to my gut but I made a huge mistake. I ended up getting so sick! Some of the worst sushi I have ever had, horrible service, and less than 1 star quality food.', 'This place is kinda like a Bennihana without the show.  Which was fine with me cuz i just wanted a quick lunch.  The steak, chicken, and shrimp were ok.  Theres so many places to eat around there i would probably try another place the next time im in the area.\\n\\nThe lunch specials are a good deal.', \"They make a great show out of the cooking process right in front of you! Just make sure you don't order sushi or seat at the bar ;)\\nAnd it's not expensive, and it tastes good! I definitely am going to this place next time I visit Santa Barbara.\", 'Though deterred by the name \"Something\\'s Fishy\" for a restaurant that serves fish, my friend and I still chose to come to this restaurant as it appears to be the only place with tapan tables in all of Santa Barbara and we were really craving fresh fried rice. We called 24 hours in advance and made a reservation for two for the tapan tables for the next evening at 7:30 PM. Upon arriving promptly at 7:30 we were first ignored for 5 to 10 minutes at the door before finally being escorted to our table, where we were seated with two other parties, two couples, one of which was clearly expecting a third person. After waiting for a waitress to arrive to take our order for over 20 minutes, a frowning teenager finally arrived and asked if we were all ready to order. The woman that belonged to the party of three that was still waiting for their third quickly responded that no, she was not ready to order because their third friend had not arrived and the waitress promptly put away her notepad and left the table. WHAT?! Apparently because this group of strangers was not ready to order, the rest of us had to wait to eat. After the third of their party finally arrived at approximately 8PM, half an hour after our reservation time, we were finally able to order. My friend and I chose to order both tapan and sushi, and when the waitress asked if we would like our sushi roll while we were waiting for the chef we said we would. We received no sushi in the next 25 minutes while waiting for the chef to arrive, but rather the roll arrived towards the end of our meal. Overall, the chef was very nice and the food was what I expected of any adequate tapan restaurant. After finishing our meal, we had to beg the waitress several times to finally deliver our check, at this point it was around 9:30PM, we had been at the restaurant for two hours, and were completely exhausted. When she finally delivered it, we were displeased to see that she had charged us full price for our sushi, despite the restaurant\\'s advertisement for half-off sushi during the time we were there.\\n\\nI will probably return here, but only because it is the only establishment in the entire city with tapan tables. The service is horrible.', \"I heard of this place and meant to try it for a long time, but was too poor to go. But then I heard they have half-price (select) sushi on weekdays! So of course we had to go try it out. \\n\\nThe only thing I'd complain about is that the wait for the sushi bar is really long. You can't sit at the Teppan Yaki tables if you're only getting sushi and the sushi bar seats only a couple of people. \\n\\nThe sushi was pretty good, although some rolls could have been made better. They were obviously in a rush since they had so many customers and so the service wasn't that great. But for $19 (not including tax + gratuity) we got 4 rolls and 4 pieces of nigiri. Overall pretty good for my sushi cravings when I'm on a tight budget.\", 'My first day off in a while took me on a day trip to Santa Barbara and a lunch at this place.  My friend and I got a recommendation for this place because of its half price Sushi Monday-Thursday.  I always get a little nervous when I hear about deals on sushi but we decided to try it out and boy am I glad we did.  Not only was the sushi a great price but it tasted really good, we got to sit and watch the chef prepare all of our food which always makes me comfortable with what I am eating but also makes me want to make my own sushi since it looks pretty easy.  Was this sushi absolutely amazing? No but it was worth paying $ 13 for 3 rolls and very enjoyable.', 'Probably one of the WORST experiences I\\'ve had in a restaurant :( Let me just start off saying, the food is good! Nothing wrong with any of the food, the chefs are amazing and we all enjoyed our food. The problem was with the service....\\n\\nWe made a reservation for 9 at 7:15 and we ended up getting their around 6:45. We were told we needed to wait because there wasn\\'t enough chefs, which is TOTALLY fine and understandable. Then the woman at the front seats a party of 2 and another party of 3. So I asked why they were able to sit down before our group (and by this time it was about 7-7:10) and she told me because they had a smaller group.... Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn\\'t we be first to sit down? We didn\\'t care if the chef wasn\\'t ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers. We were then seated and our server Ivan came over very promptly which was nice. After he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill. \\n\\nWe ordered some sushi, simple sushi. Salmon, and shrimp. We ordered 2 rolls, a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll. He brought out yellowtail, tuna and 2 veggie rolls. I kindly said that the food wasn\\'t ours and that wasn\\'t what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that\\'s what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I\\'m pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn\\'t find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said, \"do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn\\'t being cooked!\" EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him, yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways, chef comes, food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes, myself included, and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said, \"I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home, but thank you!\" (very politely) He then came back with \"ok well maybe if I take your plate away you\\'ll stop changing your mind\" WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back, which we probably won\\'t, that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day, but if your day is that bad, don\\'t come into work and be mean and rude to your customers. I work with the public and believe me, it\\'s hard to always please everyone. But it\\'s unacceptable to be rude to people!!', \"There's nothing really special about this place. My boyfriend and I decided to try it out despite the negative reviews. I understand what some of the 1 star reviews were for. Our waitress was nice but seemed like she didn't want to be there and she had a friend there visiting her and she was chatting with her and forgot that we had ordered saké. The food was okay. Nothing really bad about it, just not a place I would go back to\", \"The best Japanese restaurant! Stumbled upon this with my family and gave it a try... Dinner and a show! I saw tricks I haven't seen in any Japanese restaurant before! And every single food dish was phenomenal. If only I lived in SB! I'd be here every night!\", \"Something's Fishy was an overall excellent restaurant. I ordered the Hibachi Steak, and thoroughly enjoyed my meal along with the performance from my chef while he cooked it! This was a semi-formal restaurant, as they have dim lighting with a fairly expensive hibachi menu. The sushi however is always half-off and was extremely good. The crunchy roll was one of the best I've ever had. Beyond the food itself, the service was pretty good. Our waitress failed to notice us for awhile, and in return brought out two plates of edamame on the house to apologize. From there on it was great service. The presentation of the food was incredible. They cook your food right in front of you and even give you a show along with fairly large portion sizes that coincide with the expensive pricing of the hibachi meals. If you go here, the price greatly depends on what you order. If you go for hibachi it will be expensive, and if you go for sushi it will be a cheap comparatively to other sushi restaurants. I loved this restaurant and would highly recommend that anyone tries it! It's very welcoming to dates, large groups, and even birthday or celebration dinners.\", \"One of my all time favorite place to go with a group.  I don't care for the show and the atmosphere but the teppanyaki style is delicious.  They have the BEST dipping sauces for the meat and veggies!  I wouldn't recommend this place as a great place for Japanese food nor for sushi but I do give it props for their grilled items.\", 'This place was alright in my opinion, but not anything close to the best sushi I\\'ve ever had. The PCH roll was somewhat dry, and while the tuna sashimi and Caterpillar roll were pretty decent I\\'ve still tasted better. Ironically, the most disappointing part of the meal was the tea that my parents and I ordered. It tasted like water; absolutely no flavor whatsoever. As my dad said, \"This green tea tastes like water, and not even good water!\" Although the prices are cheaper, I\\'ll probably hit up Arigato next time I\\'m in the mood for sushi just for the better quality.', \"Well, to start the dining area is very very dark. We sat at the sushi bar and our table was dirty and sticky. Next we ordered. I got a spicy tuna hand roll and as I look over to the chef who is making our sushi, I see him scooping the spicy tuna with his bare hands and packing it into the seaweed wrap. Then I see him walk over to the microwave oven, touch that with his bare hands, touch dirty menus with his bare hands, and then go back to my spicy tuna roll and continue to scoop it and pack it with his bare hands ! I couldn't eat it after it was served to me. Since I was starving ordered another roll and ate that, but BAD IDEA. I immediately became dizzy and nauseous. I drank lots of water and decided that maybe I could walk it off. We left and continued to walk around downtown santa barbara and no longer than 20 minutes after we left my stomach started to grumble and I felt faint. After running around frantically looking for a restroom I finally found one and puked up all the sushi that I ate. I would not reccomend eating here until it is inspected..\", \"The miso soup is salty and wrong. All the cooked meats are a catastrophe (burnt, chewy, nasty etc). The always half-price sushi is stupid. \\n\\nYou're going to get full on rice.\\nThe fish itself isn't what I'd call amazing, but it definitely isn't bad. The malibu is pretty satisfying too.\", \"Ok food, poor service.\\n\\nI had dinner here on a Tuesday by myself. I was seated quickly at the sushi bar. I ordered 1 specialty roll and 2 standard rolls. The Mexican roll was excellent. Really, really good! The other 2 were not, and I only ate 1 piece of each. My tempura roll has no tempura, but the real problem was the seaweed wrappers were so strong and overbearing I could not enjoy the flavor of the fish.  I later realized there was a board of specials and wishes I had ordered off of it. They had some rolls that sounded wonderful.\\n\\nA bigger issue for me was the service. I was never given water. I was asked to move to make soave for a larger group (this is fine, happy to do it) and while I didn't mind at all, I was never given a dish for my soy sauce in my new seat. I ended up using the serving tray. These are minor inconveniences but could have been resolved if someone had checked in even once to see what I needed. I didn't even have the option to order more food if I had wanted it.\\n\\nI left hungry and disappointed.\", 'The pricing is great, and the sushi is alright. Unless you buy the expensive rolls, the sushi is just alright. Since it is so cheap, it is worth it. Nice employees and cooks', \"Fantastic service and good sushi at great prices (Half off rolls Mon-Thur and 2 for 1 sake). We sat up at the counter and the sushi chefs were friendly and very attentive even though we also had a regular server. My husband and I were taking a trip down memory lane--he had gone to college in Santa Barbara ten years ago and Something's Fishy was his favorite happy hour spot way back when. The fact that the food was up to par with his memory was a huge bonus. Ten years of consistently good food and pricing is a rare accomplishment!!\", 'Affordable sushi with amazing taste! If your in the Santa Barbara downtown area, this is the perfect place to stop in with an excellent sushi bar menu offering.', 'Went on a Friday afternoon for lunch.  We were greeted quickly and took a seat at the sushi bar.  We enjoyed the spicy tuna rolls, crab rolls and a crunchy roll.  Each was exceptionally tasty and well worth it.   We spent about $24 for the whole meal and were very pleased.  In my opinion, the reviews so far have made this place under-rated.  Go enjoy!', \"I'm not a big sushi fan, but I do like unagi.  But the reason I go here is the Benihana-style steak and shrimp meal during the early hour dinner.  For less than $20, you can get the meal, which is 4 stars, a cut below Benihana, but it's about a third the price.  The miso soup is 5 stars and their salad dressing is zesty.  Due to its reasonable prices, I'd rate it a healthy 4 star.\", \"This place is really fun. The pricing isn't too high if you're looking for an affordable dining experience in Santa Barbara. All of the staff are extremely friendly and the service is great. Sushi is always good. The hibachi is also a safe bet. Definitely recommend.\", \"The sushi is great. My personal favorite is the crunchy roll, it never disappoints. I would come here again because the food is good, but it does not get 5 stars due to the lack of quality service. My drink hardly ever gets refilled. I've learned to only order water, as the soda from the soda machine is never good- it either tastes very watered down or like liquid floor cleaner. One of the managers, a woman, is particularly rude. Luckily you don't really interact with her. Wait times can be long if you have a large party, but the good food is worth it.\", 'Love this place. The price is right, the food is good and the tables are all set up for saki bombs! The waitresses are on point and chefs talented in showmanship and presentation. I recommend you make reservations and make a night of it.', \"The service is efficient. The sushi size is larger than Sushi Teri - the most prevalent sushi place in the area - the prices are average on Fri - Sun but Mon - Thu sushi is half-price! They're quick for a call in order, a little slower it seems for in restaurant orders. The place can be pleasant if it is a weekday but it can get very crowded on the weekends. Most employees are efficient and on the nice side, but not overwhelmingly so.\", \"I don't really like this place..I needed to find a place to fix my blood sugar with my boyfriend at the time.. and came across a Japanese restaurant in Santa Barbara..it felt like a sauna and I felt like I was at Bally's..ill totally gross..food not that great..and service slow..but Santa Barbara is a great place to shop and unwind..\", \"Good lunch menu and sushi is half of during lunch. \\nThe fish is tasty too. Can't complain. I was fortunate to have picked them. To have lunch.\", 'It is very cool experience and the food is great I definitely recommend it and would gladly come back', 'Half price sushi was probably one of my favorite things to dine on when working downtown..in love with spice tuna, for some reason theirs never really did much for my taste buds, nevertheless the food is good whether your sitting at the sushi bar or doing it up getting a steak and fried rice at the group tables. Manager is friendly, staff is attentive. Just busy as hell on certain nights, but worth the wait.', \"Don't believe the bad reviews. Everything was delicious. Went with my Groupon and now I'm stuffed as heck. Highly recommend either the shrimp or scallops. Certainly pricey but you get a ton of tasty food. Also you should upgrade to the fried rice.\", 'Went to celebrate a birthday with my family and had a great time.. we went in time for the early bird specials which are a very good deal especially for the large amount of food served us. I ordered the Steak & Shrimp . The steak was flavorful and the shrimp were fresh and tasty. Our server was very good, promptly refilled drinks and pre-bussed all plates before next entree. I was surprised the entire restaurant was full on a Tuesday early evening, just another sign they are doing a great job .', \"Great stop for a quick get together. Inexpensive and good time with friends, yes. High quality sushi, no. I do not go for the atmosphere. I go for happy hour. 2 for 1 sake & half price sushi, or just takeout for half price sushi. I get the spicy tuna and PCH roll. I have never had a real problem with waiting, been lucky with this because I know there can be 45 minute waits sometimes. I find 4-6 there is no to little wait on the days I have gone.\\n\\nI repeat, they are not the best place for sushi, but I am always happy with these two rolls. I sometimes get avocado with the tuna. For the price, I can't beat it. \\n\\nI do find they are inconsistent with seating. I was allowed, with a group of friends, to sit at the hibachi tables for sushi, drinking our sake while waiting for a table because the bar was full. They then just served us there instead of moving us. Other times with different hosts we were not allowed to preorder our sake and sip while waiting, not allowed to use the hibachi empty tables.\", 'Este sitio para mí es el mejor restaurante japonés de Santa barbara, tienen una promoción todos los días a mitad de precios algunos rolls. También él servicio es bastante bueno, y los Rolls también. También tienen una zona a parte donde tienes a tu chef personal y puedes pedir arroz, vegetales,camarones,etc y el chef te los cocina en una plancha enfrente tuyo.', 'Usually I do not post reviews.  But this experience was just too bad. \\n\\nWe came to Santa Barbara for vacation. Kids love Japanese food and this is why I chose this restaurant.  Waiter was very nice but food and service by the chef was terrible.  He rushed cooking everything, not pleasant at all.  We ordered Fillet, Scallops, shrimps and Chicken.  But everything just taste the same, SALTY!  Even my kids says it the worse teppanyaki she has ever had.

Wait time was not too bad, sushi was delicious.. the only bad experience was the server came my 18 month a water glass and when he spilled it immediately like most small kids would do he made a rude comment.

The chef, Sergio, great guy and had bright future of him. Hope to see him next time as the head chef!', \"Our poorly trained waiter.  How could they have put him on the floor? It was sad. He was clueless. The food was boring and tasteless. The first time we went we sat at the sushi bar and it was okay (2 stars). This last time our party of four sat at the hibachi table and it was pretty terrible even though we ordered sushi and off the grill. It just isn't worth the money. Their is no ambience, service, or personality here. It's like a burnt out chain restaurant filled with zombies.\", \"I get sick here almost every time so it's unfortunate that everyone wants to have their birthdays here. It's dirty and the service is unfriendly. I used to really like their half off sushi deals, but I'm not sure it's worth it in the end.

Now i sayed its the same thing....and a win situatiin since they will not have our seats occupied......i asked for the main manager and she said they would come, instead a waiter came to sit us down.......FML', 'Love 1/2 off sushi during the week, and the rolls are pretty tasty! Comfort food at an affordable price for sure.', \"Sushi was good! Therefore two stars. But then I order the meal for my kids with the steak and shrimp, it was horrible undercooked rice and the salad was old you can tell because the lettuce was turning brown around the edges I didn't touch it. The portions are super small the veggies that I couldn't change for some odd reason tasted like dirt literally. The steak was bad just unseasoned really bad! I order a glass of wine and they brought me 8 day old wine that tasted like vinegar horrible! Over all the waiter was not attentive at all, the food was really bad! What a waist of 76 dollars never ever again!\", \"The sushi was pretty good, but just not the best that I've ever had. However, the food cooked on the hibachi grill was amazing. Our chef put on a great show, was very humorous, and made sure to engage us in the experience. If you want a dinner and a show, this would be a great option. Great food and a great staff.\", \"Here's the deal.  It was a day before Father's day, a Saturday. We were driving back from San Francisco. Sat at the bar with my husband, son, daughter.  I was feeling sick so we ordered mostly sushi for my husband and son.  The bill was $92.00. When I was paying the bill, the manager says, next time you should ask for the Friday and Saturday EAT ALL U CAN SUSHI and ROLLS. Now you tell me I thought.  If he had excellent customer service skills, he would a. Tell us about the SPECIALS; b. He would give me the price for the specials $22 per person even if we didnt EAT ALL WE CAN SUSHI.  Simple courtesy and sincere customer service skills are hard to come by these days; it's all about MONEY and PROFIT.  I even bought a gift card for a friend before I was given the bill. And the manager didn't care to let us know or give us credit for a special we could've taken advantaged of. Am I asking for too much?      Freya N.\", \"Visited this place while at a weekend in SB. I thought it would be comparable to Benihana and my friend recommended it.\\nHowever, everything was mediocre.

Can't beat this sushi place ... mon-thursday. I used to come here once a week. But now like once a month since I've been working way more than usual in the later hours, but definitely an SB favorite. If you haven't tried it, check it out. The Hibachi grill is fun here too, but not younger crowd oriented to come get wasted and sake bomb.\", \"The waitress serving us was so rude when we asked to have our hibachi order to be low sodium. We explained to the waitress how other hibachi grills just give our food before they add the  extra sodium for everyone else. The waitress began to cut us off when we were talking and left us high and dry in the middle of our conversation to get the manager. We decided to leave at this point and went to the front where the manager was to pay for our drinks. One of the people in my party told the manager they never drank their drink. The manager who was equally rude gave us an attitude as we were signing our receipt for all drinks and said what do you expect us to do give it to someone else? We never implied they should give it to another. We were just unsatisfied with the surface and didn't drink anything and wanted to leave.

When they were sitting us I checked the ratings and i don't know why it has 3 stars. Got a little scared but we tried the hibachi, and it was good. My favorite was the shrimp. Really good flavor. Least favorite was the chicken. I also didn't like that they didn't have noddles. But the service was nice and our cook was too. We tried the sushi sampler: it wasn't the great.

The chef we had was  super friendly and gave us large portions of high quality food.  The vegetarian dish was great as was the filet mignon and scallops.', 'The food was your average hibachi grill experience ...the sauces were not that good as they were all similar with a taste of vinegar.  I would prefer a sweet, salty, and vinegar for a variety.  The best part was we got there before 6:00 for the early bird prices.  Chicken and shrimp was about 18.95 where steak and shrimp was 20.95... It was more after 6:00.  The sushi we got to go but the sushi bar was full with many choices.

Arrived on time and were seated promptly.  Cold beer and good service overall.  Server was a bit inexperienced but he made do the best he could.  He kept us entertained and moved on past minor errors... Sushi was very good and meals were very filling.  It was difficult to serve the 10 of us, but they did very well.  Prices were reasonable.  The restaurant could use a deep clean... many of the other restaurants in the area appeared to have higher cleanliness standards.  It was fine for what it was.', \"What a turn around in just a couple of weeks. I have to say I was skeptical about going in after my last visit.

Another great aspect about this place is it\\'s location. With the reasonably priced (for Santa Barbara) parking lot right behind it we were able to leave our cars and just walk up and down State St. to work the food off.\\n\\nI would highly recommend Something\\'s Fishy and just one more time let me say: Crispy Rolls. Period.', \"Well, let me begin with saying this has been my boyfriend and mines go to dinner spot for over 2 years. We do like the food, he loves the hibachi steak and shrimp and I love the half-price sushi. They also have great fried rice. The food is not what I have to complain about. Though it is not the best sushi, it is great for the price. Sadly, this place has just been going down hill. We frequent it often, but I am ready to stop giving them my business. For the price of hibachi, we want better service. There is something going on since it seems every time we go there are completely new waiters. Maybe bad management, I'm not sure.

Very large restaurant large square tables with a man throwing knifes in the air and slicing and dicing over a skiddle so hot it spontaneously bursts into flame (how anyone walks away with their eyebrows is a wonder!) We ate at the sushi bar, packed on a Tuesday night like birds on a wire. \\n\\nService: We were quickly seated, and asked to be at the bar. We were not greeted by the men behind the sushi bar, even when we tried to make a simple chit-chat over the sushi (I praised the presentation), there was no return. While the chefs don't have to entertain, I do enjoy when they are present and attentive, which is not the case at this establishment. These guys are dishing out volume of sushi, so this is to be expected.  \\n\\nFood/drink: The sushi was good. We ate an assortment of rolls that are discounted at a happy hour of sorts. Yellow tail, eel, crab.. it was all tasty. We had a seaweed salad which was mushy as if it had been  soaking in the dressing too long.  \\n\\nSummary: Something's Fishy is the Disneyland of sushi. And some locals and tourists alike will find this place entertaining. Would I go back? Probably not. I prefer the smaller, 'hole in the wall' types of sushi places and there are several to choose from in SB.\", \"I am a native Santa Barbarian and I've been going to this place for 10+ years.  Rarely have I ever had a bad experience and I always recommend Something's Fishy to folks from out of town who want a fun experience.  Not only is their sushi the best price in town (half off, all the time) but their hibachi is to die for!  Always, always, always get the fried rice!  My family is completely spoiled because their fried rice is so good.  It doesn't taste as good anywhere else.  Nearly every single hibachi chef I have had does a great job with entertaining, although every now and then (typically during the lunch hour) I have had a chef who is new/learning, so he didn't do as many tricks.  Every now and then a chef will come up with something completely different that I've never seen before, and that's always a treat!\\n\\nI have had their halibut, chicken, shrimp, and steak and all of it is good.  You can't go wrong.  The best deal you can get is their deluxe filet mignon dinner which comes with miso soup, salad with an amazing ginger dressing, fried rice, grilled vegetables, and mochi ice cream for dessert.  The filet mignon simply melts in your mouth.  Exquisite.\\n\\nSave room for dessert because their fried green tea ice cream is without a doubt one of my favorite desserts of all time.  You get the fried tempura outside that is warm and crunchy with the refreshing green tea ice cream center... my mouth is watering just thinking about it.\\n\\nThis place is definitely worth your time, but it does get busy during dinner, especially on the weekends.  So if you have a large group, I would highly recommend calling and making a reservation.  They also have an early bird special with discounts off their hibachi, as long as you get there and order between the hours of 3:00-6:00 PM.\", 'We were in Santa Barbara yesterday for an event at the Fess Parker. We decided to get something to eat before driving back and we stumbled upon this Hibachi Steakhouse. We looked at the other reviews and decided to give it a try and we are delighted that we did. We were immediately greeted the moment we walked in and seated right away. We got our menus and drinks within a couple of minutes fantastic food and service, which was quite surprising based on the previous reviews of wait times and horrible service. This will be a regular spot for us. Really was impressed with one of the managers, Yukari for being on top of everything.', 'Following the whole Hibachi/Benihana idea, Something\\'s Fishy is a place I\\'ve been to many a time when coming home to SB. Its somehow got a little homey attachment to it for me, but after eating here quite a few times you realize that without the whole SHOW and food Dance, the food is \"Meh, ok\" at best. \\n\\nGetting any hibachi dish will taste essentially the same, because they use about 2 spices for everything, while fancifully grilling it on a Hibachi stove. This place isn\\'t somewhere to go for good food. \\nInstead go for the action of the chefs, the volcano onions, and all other Kitschy disneyfied food creation.\\nAdd in some Sake Bombing, and it makes the whole experience much more fun! If you\\'ve got kids, take them here they\\'ll love the show that puts your food, literally, on fire! My friend recalled that in his childhood he thought these kinds of chefs were \"the best in the world,\" go here and maybe your child will think so too.\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t got kids, then knock back a few sake bombs and let the fresh food with a fire-y pizazz put you in a daze, while you munch on the fire\\'s creations. \\n\\nNote: this place\\'s prices have gone up quite steeply over the years, and probably will go up again. As of now, its pushing the limits of value for quality/food/entertainment, but I wouldn\\'t go if it gets any more expensive.', 'Delicious sushi with a great atmosphere. Located right off State St. this place is easy to find and always satisfies. Great for groups or a date for two seated at the bar.', \"Had it for dinner with a group of friends. Food is overpriced definitely for the Benihana-styled cooked food. It's entertaining to watch the chefs cook your food in front of you, but my steak was overcooked and really dry. The rest of the food was not that great. Service was also slow. \\n\\nThe only reason we gave two stars is for the half priced sushi days, but even then it's only mediocre. The service for that was prompt, but the fish in the rolls are puny. It's filling for something cheap.\", \"A great show at the teppanyaki tables, and a nice long sushi bar. The sushi is average at best, but definitely hits the spot, and it's cheap and thus plentiful.

Get drink refills when you can.\", 'The waitress and wait staff was very friendly and helpful. But I would definitely not recommend the hibachi grill or sushi. The rice and everything was full of butter that it changed the color of the rice. The sushi that was raw was good, but than again when it came to baked rolls, they dropped the ball again. The vegetables lacked seasoning, as did the rice, if you ignore the mountain of cholesterol they call butter.', \"I would only go during happy hour when the rolls are half off. Even still, I've had cheaper and better sushi elsewhere.\", 'First time in Santa Barbara during Fiesta and apart from the festival and the confetti-filled eggs, dining at Hibachi was the highlight of my trip.\\n\\nThe food was amazing! The staff was great! Our chef Francisco was the star of the show! Oh and did I mention that the food was amazing?!\\n\\nI highly recommend this place, whether it\\'s for the sake bombs, hibachi, sushi, or sake bombs (yes, I know I have \"sake bombs\" twice but that\\'s because of the amount of sake bombs I had that night) I\\'m sure you won\\'t be disappointed.', \"I have only come here for the sushi and for half-off sushi this is a great spot. It loses stars for its inconsistent sushi rolls. I usually like the Tomsan roll which is a yummy eel roll with other ingredients but occasionally there is hardly a piece of eel in it. However, it's half off - so I really cannot complain. The service is outstanding and the sushi chefs are great people. \\n\\nI would recommend this spot more for lunch considering dinnertime brings forth the louder and more annoying crowd. It is also filled with birthdays and this restaurant's birthday song is horrid to the ears - the tambourine needs to be destroyed! \\n\\nIf you want fast, cheap sushi then this is the place for you - you will find me here often during the day!\", \"Food is great.

Spending just over $10 per person and getting full on purely sushi? Hells yes.

The customer service was good, but the sushi  and rolls was tasteless.  Fish was not fresh.  It has no taste.  The rolls are mostly rice.  To make matters worst, they were skimpy on the fillings and the sauce.  Their most expensive roll ($18), which I was looking forward to try, was so bland, all I tasted was soy sauce.  I literally felt I ate a $18 bowl of white rice with soy sauce!!!  The only tasty item was their Eel sushi which was, unfortunately, ruined by long pieces of fine bones.  I\\'m no expert in sushi, but I have tasted better sushi in supermarket and small establishments.  Don\\'t call yourself a sushi bar until you perfected your food.  Cost was not a factor, cuz I was expecting to pay more at tourist spots.

Asked for a crunchy roll and got an avocado roll with minimal crunches on top. Seems like every year the quality of this restaurant is downgrading.

Which made no sense to me.  When I got there she stated she didn't want people to get use to doing that. Which means to me. She doesn't want people to get use to ordering food and enjoying there meal. She had the worst attitude and I told her that she had the worst customer service I've ever seen. Like I said before.

I took it at first as a gut instinct to associate his idea of good sushi with my idea of good sushi.  Not to act all snobbish about raw fish, but his idea of good sushi turned out to be rolls which were mediocre at best (more than 2/3\\'s were deep fried in one way or another) and a minimal Nigiri list.  By minimal I am referring to old, dry octopus and hot pink tuna.  The service was slow and pretty much every bite I had made me angrier at myself for having listened to this guy\\'s recommendation.

Good for dates and friends.  \\nIt's Benihana of the Central California Coast!\", \"We like to eat here when we visit Santa Barbara either for All-You-Can-Eat sushi or half price sushi.

I was pissed, and having a food and beverage background myself, I told her that this was not allowed, and that I wanted to speak to her supervisor.  The supervisor made it sound like it was the waitress' fault, and never took ownership.  I saw them 5 min. later standing next to front door/host stand rolling their eyes w/ other servers and looking at our table.  I know they get away w/ this all the time and people just assume that they have to pay it.  This is shady business from top down...

Sushi is my favorite. I eat sushi almost once a week. This, this was bland and took forever to get. When we first arrived the host was super nice and sat us right away at the sushi bar. We ordered waters and then he went away. He brought them back along with our waiter and we told our waiter we where getting sushi and would like two green teas. It took a while to get them and I had to ask for the check and he took forever to run my card as well. As for the sushi... We ordered Fresh water Eel sushi and a salmon and shrimp roll. The eel was terribly cooked and the roll was gross. It tasted like mayonnaise. \\n\\nReason I did not give them a one star is because of how wonderful the host was and how quick he brought our water to us and made sure we were happy before turning us over to our waiter.', \"I've been coming to something's fishy since I was a small child, when it was in Piccadilly square!

Anyone who eats sushi here has a stomach of steel!\\nWe had our order in first, yet the chef showed up for the other half of the table(no small children)   As we are watching the best chef there from behind- my kids start getting grumpy and asking where our food is. I'm wondering the same. Then the worst chef ever shows up to cook for us. I have always left with leftovers. This was so freaking disgusting- I left it for the trash!\\nAs stated in previous complaints, the server rarely came to check on us and could tell we were getting pissed. When he brought the check- I almost flipped my lid! He added on a 15% gratuity! Are you kidding me? A couple with three kids gets gratuity added on? We always tip 20% because we both worked in restaurants and know that servers aren't to blame for kitchen issues. When leaving, my husband had to hold me back from the front desk because he didn't want me to make a scene. I am still pissed a week later!  \\nOh, and when we were leaving, I lost my balance and touched the chair rail on the wall- oh my god it was covered in grease!

Like many of its ilk, it tries to do a lot of things - huge sushi bar, dozens of teppanyaki tables with the usual theatrics, and other classic Japanese items. My friend had a Groupon, and we even remarked that it felt like we were seated at the \"Groupon table\" with another family that also had the same chicken and steak hibachi deal :)\\n\\nThe service is insanely slow. Yes, you may be seated at the table quickly, but if another one of the chefs is busy, you might wait 15-20 minutes for the \"show\" to begin. As a consolation, their miso soup and salad are tasty. Like most airlines, everything fancy costs extra. But I thought the portions of chicken, steak, veggies, and rice were tasty and filling, and the trio of sauces we were given helped add another dimension to the meal.\\n\\nI am only giving this place three stars because of the service, but I will definitely visit again and try more items.', \"It's world war three up in here, because everyone is always dropping sake bombs. \\n\\nIt's the PLACE to BE in Santa Barbara, and with that half price deal on weekday evenings, I feel like a thief when I eat here.

We have visited this restaurant in the past and sat at the sushi bar, and the experience has been fine.  However we recently sat at a table because the sushi bar was full, and we ordered sushi through a waitress.  \\n\\nThe experience was horrendous.  Not only did our server appear very disinterested in our group, but also she failed to take any responsibility when she gave our sushi order to the group sitting next to us, causing us to wait almost an hour to receive any food.  After inquiring about our food multiple times due to the significant delay (and having to flag down our server to do so because she was avoiding our table), we were finally served some sushi, but it was not our order.  We told the bus boy because our server continued to avoid us and failed to follow up on what she served us, and he told our server and the manager at the front.  However, nothing was done.  We again had to seek out our server and physically approach her as she fled from the area near our table.  After telling her that we were sure that she served our order to the group next to us, as they were discussing everything they were served out loud and in a perplexed manner (e.g. they were confused by the veggie roll I ordered), she still refused to admit that she had mixed up the order and made little effort to correct the situation.\\n\\nAfter determining that we would never be served with the food we ordered, we left (the rest of my group wanted to eat the sushi we were served with even though it was the wrong order, but I am super picky so I refused, and I was in no mood to continue fighting with the server to get the right food).  On the way out, we approached the manager, who fleetingly apologized while repeatedly saying that there was nothing he could do.  When asked how we would be compensated, he mentioned that we would not have to pay for the wrong sushi order with which we were served.  When we pointed out that we were of course not paying because we were not eating the incorrect order, he said there was nothing else he could do.  I at least expected a better apology, if not some sort of voucher to return and be served with the right order in a timely manner.\\n\\nMy expectations are not usually that high for restaurant service, but waiting over an hour for sushi, being ignored by our server, and not being compensated crosses too many lines for me.  I will not be returning to this restaurant and hope others avoid it too until they can show a little more respect their customers.\", \"The service was good, so that's why I gave it 2 stars, but sadly I got food poisoning. Within the hour of leaving there my stomach began to hurt and about an hour later I was vomiting. I have now spent the past 2 days sick in bed. Not able to hold anything in or down. All I ate was the chicken and steamed rice. I will NOT be going there again.\", \"I got food poisoning from california rolls and vegetable tempura. I didn't even think that was possible.

I barely tried my dish when the waiter comes to take off my fiancé\\'s plate, so curtly that he spilled all the grassy soja sauce from the plate on my white silk dress... But it is not the worst, the worst is the guy not even apologized but made as if nothing happened! My fiancé and I, as well as the other people at the table were all so chocked! As the waiter left me covered of sauce, I finally get to catch another staff member to explain him what just happened. That\\'s when the waiter comes back and speak over my voice and say to his colleague who happened to be his manager (he didn\\'t even talk to me directly!)\"come on, i didn\\'t do it on purpose!\".

We came when there were a moderate amount of people. It took forever for the waitress to take our orders, to get our food and to get our check. We were there for practically two hours. It was like, 20 min to order our food, 1 hour to get our food or  to eat and/or wait for my other friends to get their food, and 40 minutes for our check to come.

All I had was sushi and all I have to say is that it's okay. I had better. My other group of friends didn't like their dishes. They order a seperate side of fried rice with chicken or something. They're orders came really late. They finally got their food when the rest of us finished our food. Their food was cold. The rice and chicken was cold. Many of my friends weren't happy.

How is that even possible? The Hibachi cook took at least 30 minutes to serve us (and no he wasn't busy with other tables, he was fooling around in the back eating fruit snacks. Probably should hide the back kitchen rather than have a huge window looking into it).  When he finally decided to do his job, he managed to mess up every single thing. I am not joking. He couldnt even smile either. Also he cooked one less fried rice than we ordered and when we told him he was short he pouted. Everything (veggies, rice, chicken) was undercooked. Rancid. We had to ask TWICE for a knife to cut each individual piece to make sure it wasn't completely raw. And finally they completely butchered our checks and added a 18% gratuity (as if everything wasn't outrageously expensive to begin with) because why not: f us right? 0 stars. Negative stars. No.\", 'Had dinner here on Saturday night, We asked to be seated at a hibachi table and we were seated with a young group of guys and girls who were celebrating a birthday. Anyways, we ordered sake and Sapporo so that we could do sake bombs. By the end of sinner we did about 10 sake bombs and went through about 3 large Sapporo and 3 orders of sake between the 2 of us. Lets just say I was feeling good by the end of dinner. Also the waitress and the cook, Lupe did sake bombs with us as well. Also, the manager came by to randomly talk to me and my friend, and he told us how crazy it gets in here with all the college kids, and like right after that, the group we were seated with began to act just as he described, but we had fun! As for the food, we had steak and chicken hibachi with fried rice and also a rainbow on the side. I remember enjoying the rainbow roll, miso soup and salad. By the time the real food came, I believe it was just okay, but I was like 5 sake bombs in by that point! Overall I think its a good place to go with a group to have a good time.', \"Hadn't been here in a long while and still food tasted as good as before. Can't say less about the nice live cooking show we get when ordering hibachi.\", \"Hibachi or Sushi?   Do I have to choose only one?  I absolutely love this place!  The food has always been delicious each time I've ventured into this hot spot.

When we got home we opened the to go box and found 1 order of california rolls, 1 order of philidelphia rolls, and 2 orders of some random rolls with chicken and imitation crab stick.\\n\\n umm??? we payed for 6 rolls, and got 4. 2 of which we didnt even order. by then, it was too late to go back, so we just ate it. It didnt even tase very good, it was very mediocre.', \"I've only been to Something's Fishy twice and I will never return again. I have no complaints about the food, but their service leaves a lot to be desired. Both times I've been there the Teppanyaki chef was rude, quiet, and not entertaining in the least bit. He did not engage or do anything special and the servers are even ruder. The first time it took over 45 minutes to receive the check and it was incorrect. The second time I ate there, the chef spilled VERY hot tea all over our table and me. No one offered an apology or even a napkin, not the chef, manager, or server. In fact, the server walked over and placed my salad in the water and just walked away. My friend had to get up and ask for some napkins and a towel. NO ONE cared and trust me, not only was it a mess, but scolding hot tea, does not feel particularly good in your lap. This restaurant has great potential, but they need better training on customer service and just basic etiquette.\", 'Where do I start with this gem? The hostess giving us a 3.5 hours waiting window even though multiple tables were empty or the waiter who acted aloof at every request we had or the chef who looked depressed with his stained apron and half ass attempt to cook the food properly. In short, places like these should not be in business, and people should avoid them at any cost.', \"I tried going to Something's Fishy on Valentine's Day because I heard that the happy hour prices were amazing. I checked online to make sure the hours were right, then drove 20 minutes to the location. However, appearently they don't do happy hour prices on Valentine's Day. So I drove 15 miles for nothing, then had to find another place to eat. I think its ridiculous they changed their happy hour schedule without notice, simply because they knew people would be going there. Warning: Don't go to Something's Fishy unless you call ahead to see if they've changed their policies \\n\\n-Won't be going back because they talk advantage of customers.\", 'the service was so horrible today, i waited like almost an hour for sushi, (sushi was great like always, and the guys making them awesome) but the waiter was really bad, it took him like 15 min. just to go ask us what we wanted to drink. ok so we ordered our drinks and a dinner box, (dinner box comes with soup and salad) so he brought the dinner box first, then the soup, and when we were finish and ready to go, he brough the rise, but he never bring the salad nor he asked if we need it something. i been there many times and today was a really bad experience with the service.', \"They're half priced rolls are really not half priced... It's marketing. I've been to many places and the prices are somewhat the same.

They do ok here. Can't beat it for the price.\", \"Well I think this restaurant is great! :)\\n\\nIt is a popular place to go in SB. The sushi is delicious and the atmosphere is great too.

It is worth it.\\n\\nIf you're complaining or contemplating about the quality of food from this place (which you shouldn't :) ) then don't try it. You'll end up disappointing yourself.

Impeccable food and service.\", 'This place is cheap during the week but it should be all the time. Most likely you will wait for a long time and the sushi is not that good. So even though its cheaper, its because it should be. Also our waitress seemed a little drunk hahah.', \"I went to Something's Fishy on Saturday for an early, casual dinner with about ten friends. We immediately sat ourselves at the sushi bar. The service was fast and the sushi chefs immediately made our orders. The sushi was 'ok' at best. I ordered a rainbow roll and sashimi plate. The rainbow roll looked like any other rainbow roll I've ever had, but lacked much flavor. The sashimi plate was a big disappointment. It only included two types of fish. I would not recommend it! On the upside, they do make a big deal, with drums and all, if it's your birthday.\", \"If I could give them zero stars, I would. Came here for Julie's 21st birthday. Out of all the places we could have gone in Santa Barbara, we unfortunately chose this place, which we've been to many times. We will no longer go here.\\n\\nFirst off, it took them 35 minutes to seat us (group of 4) for sushi. They wouldn't let us sit at one of the 10 empty hibachi tables, because they were hibachi only. This should have been the first warning sign. Eventually, since it was getting late and every other restaurant was practically closed, we pleaded them to let us sit at a hibachi table. They did.\\n\\nAnyway, we ordered drinks, food, and spent a lot of money. We didn't get a roll we had ordered, but they still tried to charge us for it. Despite it being clear that it was Julie's birthday, they did not bring out a cake like they did for other people, which is fine but annoying. Overall, the service was very bad, and the waiter made it clear she didn't care.\\n\\nThey then put a mandatory 18% gratuity charge on our bill! Wtf?! \\n\\nSteer clear of this place.\", \"Heard a lot about this place while living in Santa Barbara but I never got a chance to try it, during a visit back I finally got the chance and I was kind of disappointed... the hostess got confused as to what we wanted (just sushi, not the benihana) and seated us at the table but when our waitress came by asking us what we wanted we said sushi and she got confused and we ended up having to move to the sushi bar (which had very limited seating, you literally touch elbows with the person next to you..) the sushi was ok, kind of plain, the fish didn't taste that fresh (which is a bit weird seeing as how the ocean is RIGHT there, theres no excuse for the fish not being fresh..). I've definitely had better sushi/service/seating elsewhere..\", \"What has happened to this restaurant?  Have been coming here for about twenty years.  Last night came with our two sons.  My husband and I split an entree which we often do.  In the past we still would have both received a miso soup and salad.  Not last night.  We were pointedly given ONE miso soup and ONE salad.  Okay fine, no biggie.  Then started to notice the wait for our cook was getting longer and there were no cooks in our room.  I asked the manager what was going on and he said they did not have enough cooks and it would be ten minutes.  Twenty minutes later our cook finally appeared.  No apologies from anyone.  We were given a beer but had already had a beer.  I don't know if there has been a change of ownership, but definitely there is a change in attitude.  Extremely disappointing.\", 'Get any server but Taylor. She should not be server. To start, it was my bachelorette dinner, which we told her and she didn\\'t even say congratulations. She brought miso soups with no spoons. We waited for her to come back and bring spoons but she never did. We had to ask another server for spoons and other utensils because we were missing chopsticks. On top of that 4 out of 5 people in my group got our entrees and 30 minutes later the chef noticed that my friend had no food and we told him we were waiting for a crunchy roll. He then told the manager about it and Taylor said she would check on it. 5 minutes later the manager brought the roll and 15 minutes after that Taylor finally brought a crunchy roll as my friend was almost done with the roll. She realized she messed up and instead of apologizing she said \"shoot\" and walked away. Unbelievable! She also did not offer to refill my iced tea which is a pretty basic server thing to do. Our hibachi chef was great and observant but Taylor was just awful. She never smiled even once. I can\\'t believe she is in customer service with such a cold attitude. I had to just laugh at the situation because it was so unbelievable. Thanks Taylor for making this a memorable night that I will never forget.', 'This is obviously the best and only place to get Sushi in Santa Barbara. 1/2 sushi is the BUSINESS and even when you come on the wrong day, you can always order \"all you can eat sushi\" at a decent price. \\n\\nIf you\\'re sitting on the bar- don\\'t forget the option to order a lunch box or dinner box. You can never go wrong with that- it has miso soup, like 3 diff. sides, sushi, and tempura! Don\\'t forget to upgrade to fried rice cause it\\'s friggin AMAZING. \\n\\nLastly, if you\\'re looking for a special roll with a bit of a spicy twist, please please please order the Mexican roll. You won\\'t be disappointed. It\\'s an orgasmic experience of salmon, crab, avocado, spicy mayo, jalapeno and all kinds of other good ish! I\\'m wishing I had one this very moment...too bad I graduated and moved back home 3 hours away. *tears*\\n\\nAnyways, for families with children, may I suggest coming at a reasonable dinner time...this restaurant does sell alchy && it IS on State st. so if you\\'re coming after 8- expect to be bombarded with ready to party college students. \\n\\nTis all.', \"What a great Japanese Hibachi restaurant in Santa Barbara This was our first time in Santa Barbara this weekend and wow do i have to say it was amazing\\nThe chef Roberto really put on an impressive show and made the dining experience fun, and Entertaining for My Family and I.\\nOnce again thank you Staff and we look forward to our next visit to something's Fishy!\", \"This place is only worth going because of the half price sushi.

I personally love the Mexican Roll. 1/2 price sushi is ALL DAY Sun-Thurs and \"All-you-can-eat\" sushi @ the bar ONLY is ALL day Friday & Saturday. If you want Hibachi (the tables where they cook for you)  I would HIGHLY recommend calling in and making reservations ahead of time to ensure your seats; it gets pretty busy. And unfortunately they don\\'t take Sushi bar reservations because there\\'s only what? 26 seats? I mean if your dumb ass reserves 8 seats and you don\\'t come in on time the restaurant looses money by holding your seats for someone who isn\\'t there when there\\'s people that could be sat =( So it makes sense that it\\'s a \"first come- first serve\" policy. Anyways, the filet mignon is to die for @ the Hibachi grill and if you\\'re looking for more bang for the buck try the Dinner Box or the Lunch Box at the sushi bar. It\\'s orgasmic. OH, and don\\'t forget dessert. If you\\'ve never had a tempura ice cream you need to try it! DEEP FRIED YUMMINESS. By the way, if you\\'re 21 and up, don\\'t forget to Sake-Bomb it. :) And if you\\'re not into beer like me, try the plum wine. Absolutely love it.', \"Honestly, the sushi is terrible, but this place is not bad for teppan.

If you're looking for a good experience at this place, go to the teppan grill and you won't be disappointed.\", \"Had my Iphone stolen from our table as it was being bussed. I discovered this while I was sitting at the table only moments later and I informed the management. The management suggested that perhaps my friends who I was dining with took it... and they did not believe that their staff was capable of taking my property. This is all very troubling and I can't support an establishment that takes this stance towards customer service... or lack thereof. I wouldn't trust this place with my jacket, definitely not going to trust it to make me raw fish sushi rolls!!\", \"Now I know that as a Teppan Yaki chef you've done your routine a million times: making a flaming volcano out of the onion rings, flipping the rice bowl around with your spatula, etc., but at least try to fool me into thinking you enjoy your job.  Teppan Yaki costs so much because you're supposed to be putting on goddamn show.  Dance, monkey, dance!\\n\\nOther than our chef being half asleep while he was cooking, the food and service was good.  Finished dishes were removed promptly, glasses were refilled, and any extras we needed were brought right away.  The food was pretty good, probably not the best Japanese food I've ever had, but it was tasty.  I did wish they would've had all white meat chicken as an option.\\n\\nThey have Kirin on tap, which is a nice perk when your Teppan chef is putting the table to sleep with his lackluster moves.\", \"Just got back from dinner there.

PCH roll is awesome. And while not half off the crunch roll never disappoints. Rarely a wait unless Thursday night. You'll wanna reserve a hibachi table for large groups though. You do sit around a table with people you don't know but there's plenty of space and you don't notice. They do a fun little cooking show in front of you. Go between 4-5 for early bird hibachi and it's way cheaper. Worth going to for sure.\", 'Such a disappointment. After dining here for years it has changed it\\'s name (supposedly with the same owners, our waitress informed us) from the creative and fun \"Something\\'s Fishy\" to a boring, cookie-cutter \"Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar\".

We had to ask for one person\\'s sushi (all she ordered) around the time when the rest of us were practically finished with our meals. The man cooking the hibachi was talented, as they all are, juggling his tools etc., but he looked about as bored as humanly possible and not once looked any of us in the eye or cracked any sort of smile.

Too many other great restaurants in SB.', \"The hostess sat us down at a grill and never once mentioned that they had one chef working. There was another grill with two people sitting there.  It would've made sense to sit us with them, but the manager never thought about that. After a 45 min wait and finally being told that they only had one chef working, we closed our check and left. It wasn't the waitresses fault, the hostess should've mentioned it to us when we first walked in before being seated. The hostess happened to be the MANAGER!\", \"I would give this place 4 stars in Milwaukee, just 3 stars in Santa Barbara.  The sushi took a LONG time to make.  Instead of putting the sushi out as it was prepared, the sushi chef put all of it out on one platter.  It was very fresh, we were right on the ocean.  Wasn't crowded, we went between lunch and dinner.  Price point about right for area.  No uni, everyplace was out, so not a huge issue.  Food was good, as expected, just wasn't blown away.  I would return if in the mood for sushi.\", \"This place saved me after a trip from Cambria. I remember asking the front desk of our hotel if there was a sushi place in town...he laughed. Much to my surprise the town closes down at 8:00pm on Saturday and Cambria only caters to hamburgers and wine tasting. Which would be fine if I didn't have a hankering for sushi. So you can imagine my delight on our way home when we stopped off at this place in SB for a bite.\\n\\nNot only was the sushi half off on Sunday from 2:00-5:00pm but they put the nori on the outside so you get more seaweed vs. when it's typically rolled on the inside.

I got the hibachi (salmon + fried rice). The performance was entertaining - our cook was friendly. I honestly really loved the salmon. I received a lot more than I expected, which is nice. The salad and sauces were pretty good as well. I recommend this place at night, it's dimly lit and has a nice ambiance. Expensive, but a nice experience. Make sure your whole party is there when you arrive, or else they can't start the hibachi. The wait was a little while, even though we made a reservation (however, it was a Friday night). Never tried the rolls, so don't have anything to say about that.\", 'My sister and I were quickly seated at the sushi bar on a busy Saturday night. The servers were friendly, and the menu offered half price sushi. My favorite was the crunch roll. \\nThis place is definitely a good date spot in downtown SB. They also have hibachi tables, which I will go back and try.', 'I love this place I go here all the time for sushi takeout because the half price rolls are great and they open right around lunch. I get the tuna roll with avocado added which is fifty cents extra but worth it. Also the somethings fishy roll is good and the spicy garlic edamame.

Setting at the hibachi grill with friends is fun, but I really prefer to belly up to the sushi bar. The half priced sushi is just that, simple but good. The specialty rolls are great. The service from the staff has always been good even when the place is packed. There is not much more to say, the food is reasonably priced  and good. The service is always attentive to their customers. I have ate here twice this week. I hope this helps.', \"So me and a large group of friends went to partake of the half priced sushi deal. There were more or less about 12 of us and we all were paying for our own. The size of the sushi was slightly on the smaller side, but it was at a reasonable price. Our waitress was okay and not necessarily great. \\n\\nThe reason for such a low rating is because the overall service was terrible. We were waiting for a very long time for our food to come out (I worked in a restaurant and even when we had big parties we still bought out the food in a reasonable amount of time. But what really put the nail in the coffin was the fact that they refused to split the bill for us. It took us over an hour trying to figure out who owed what because:\\n\\nA) we're a freakin' huge party that ordered over $200 worth of food \\nB) the receipt had the full price of the items with the total discount listed on the bottom, which complicated who owed what exactly since not all the items were half off\\n\\nCommon sense would say that a restaurant would have a system to automatically split the bill to avoid issues like this and frustrate so many patrons. Common sense would say that the waitress would not blow off said group and put the orders in for us since we are being forced to pay a gratuity. Common sense would also say that the owner of the restaurant should step in at some point and be helpful in trying to help the customers move on with their days. And common sense would say that if you are capable of charging over 12 individual cards a portion of the bill then you owe it to them to make their life easier and split the damn bill. Their excuse was that big parties normally give in and just have one person pay for the entire bill, I'm assuming they get home and go insane from trying to figure out how much they owe the individual. \\n\\nAs a side note, their women's restroom door for some reason slams, so be careful ladies when you leave.\", \"I find it kind of funny how I find myself missing this place when I never found it entirely delicious when I lived in SB. Perhaps its just the memories of my 8 friends and I weekly gathering along the long sushi bar after a long 6 hour class at Brooks... Or perhaps it was the half-price weekday lunch special that kept our wallets AND our stomachs pleased. The fish wasn't always daily fresh and the rolls could never be compared to Edomasa but the service was decent and the food usually hit the spot. For poor, hungry college students, something fishy is a great lunch spot.\", 'My friend and I went at 5:25 for the Early Bird menu which is 3-6pm.  Place was empty with the exception of 2 tables.  There was 1 chef.  They would not seat us but instead told us to wait \"maybe 10-15 mins\" because they only had 1 chef.  What??  The chef was cooking for one table and still had the other table to cook for next.  After 15 minutes, no extra chefs, still not seated and not even able to order a drink while we waited, we left.

First time I came with my bf, friend & her bf: there were 4 of us. Second time I came with my sister and her friends, there were 6 of us. Both times we did the whole Hibachi/Benihana deal.\\n\\nThe food was alright, average tasting. I would say the best part of the meal was the fried rice. Our chef was cool & funny. Of course he did some tricks (flaming onion volcano) and rhythmic banging while he cooked. I had a good time with my friends here.  I wouldn't come back for the food per se but wouldn't mind coming back for another fun experience.\", 'I can\\'t believe how a \"supposedly nice\" Japanese restaurant located in the prime center of downtown state street can be so disorganized and sloppy. I took a super hot date here a couple days ago expecting amazing service but received the complete opposite. Where do I start... let\\'s see.. for starters, when we sat down at the sushi bar (without any hostess attending us lol) we were simply thrown 2 menus from the chefs without a single word from them. I wasn\\'t told what to do from the start nor did anybody seem to care when I was ready to order. I had to hand the menu back myself. After that, we literally sat there for 50 minutes before someone came to give us Water. 50 MINUTES. Let that sink in. I\\'ve never witnessed such pathetic and disrespectful service before. Given we were sitting at the sushi bar, I could see everything the chefs were doing. It took them 40 minutes just to GET to our order and start preparing it. Keep in mind we ordered a salad which means all these cucks had to do was grab the salad and toss it onto a plate. But guess what? It took them 50 minutes to do that as well!!! LOL!!! On top of the fact that NOBODY asked us what we wanted to drink or if we needed anything, we were ready to get up and leave.. but my smoking hot babe of a date insisted on staying since we were both starving. Our food finally came 50 minutes after we sat down, and I had to raise my hand and ask for my own drink. Get this, I asked for a certain soda and instead I was brought tea... I don\\'t understand who you people hire but you need to get your shit together. 50 minutes to give us water and food... 50 MINUTES!!!!!! I was sitting at the table for almost an hour before anybody even offered us anything.. It was as if they didn\\'t even know we were there lmao.... and yes they were aware of us because multiple servers kept serving the people next to us and looked at us.. pathetic Dweebs\\n\\nThat being said, that night will be the last time I ever come back to that god forsaken scat-worthy service place again.', 'The food was great we had habachi steak and shrimp with fried rice !

It was pretty busy when I came here, but the service was still extremely fast! I felt a little bad, I must've looked really bored because the chef saw me with my chin in my hands and handed us cucumber salads while we were waiting. I thought that was really awesome customer service. Even with how busy he was with other peoples' rolls, he saw that we were waiting and gave us stuff to eat in the meantime. The Christmas roll really stood out to me, it was delicious! Definitely looking forward to coming back here\", \"Something is certainly fishy about the place.. Overpriced, check, dead fly in salad, check, dry chicken, check. You are lucky I gave you 2 stars (I didn't get food poisoning so you have that going for you).

The food was pretty good, really enjoyed the fried rice. Steak was a little over cooked (asked for medium rare, not a lot of pink) but still a pleasant dinner. Had a really good time, suggest getting the hot sake and beer. Large portions! And free green tea ice cream for the birthday :)', \"Believe the previous reviews that say this place is bad.  We saw the mixed reviews but chose to try it instead as my son loves this type of food.  The service was bad from the very beginning.

Last Tuesday was yet another confirmation why.  Took at least three repetitions to get them to correct my wife\\'s order that they misunderstood.  And, of course, having come in with two children, they placed us at the \"kids table\" with a God-forsaken 2 year-old from hell.  Howling at 100+ decibels, running free throughout the place, taking things off of shelves (including other patrons\\' purses), this kid was hell on earth.\\n    Admittedly, we messed up when we forgot to include our Axxess discount card.  And they kindly agreed to refund the original amount and do a new charge with the discount.  But then were somehow unable to reprocess the new amount, and made us go get cash.  For $150 for 3 adults and one child (our 2nd is still an infant) we deserve better.', \"Hibachi grill restaurants are definitely great places to celebrate special occasions such as birthdays. We decided to go for my roommates birthday. The service was a bit slow, but pretty friendly. \\nThey give plenty of food; soup, salad, fried rice, vegetables and your entree. For my entree I ordered the vegetarian tofu and vegetables, and boy was that a mistake. It was honestly just plain tofu and bell peppers, no flavor what so ever. \\nThey didn't even try to make an effort to make a creative or appetizing dish. The other sides were okay, very bland and lacking much flavor. \\n\\nOverall not the best Japanese restaurant, then again Santa Barbara does not have many options for those craving good Japanese food.\\n\\nI'll stick to Benihanna\", 'We were there for Teppanyaki dinner.\\nIt is really fun watching the chef cooking in front of you doing some fire tricks however the food is not that good for the price.\\nSo it is just a one time deal. :(', 'This place is good and fast!!

The server brought us the soup and the salad first. The miso soup was OK  but the salad - just a bunch of lettuce leaves drowned in dressing sauce. After 10-15 minutes, the steamed rice is served to us and short after the chef arrives.\\nI got steak it was ok. Even though I ordered medium, I got  well done. Service is nice and I like how to see a chef cook in front of us.', 'We had a wonderful meal here. We sat at one of the hibachi tables and had a mix of the hibachi dinners and sushi.

Even with happy hour prices. When I came here, I got all the sushi I wanted for under 15 dollars. Glory Hallelujah. \\n\\nOf the happy hour specials, I highly recommend the spicy yellowtail. It has a good amount of fish, the fish is left in chunks (not chopped up like spicy tuna), and a delightful spicy sauce. So good!\", \"I've definitely had better sushi...much better.\\n\\nThe rolls were sloppily made and were 75% rice with barely any sushi, if any. And they add the sauce on like it's the main ingredient! THE FISH IS THE MAIN INGREDIENT! I feel like I was being tricked into believing that what I was eating was sushi. \\n\\nService was ok. I'm a big believer in good service. But 30 minutes of waiting with no water and having to ask the waitress to get us water is a big no no for me. And I was a waiter for sometime and I NEVER let my patrons go without getting their drink order.\\n\\nMaybe I'm too big of a snob or maybe this place isn't that great. Something is fishy alright, and it's not the sushi.\", 'Dont be fooled by half off like we were.  They are doubling the price on the simple rolls that are normally $4-5 elsewhere.  Plus the portion is small!', 'I normally love this place for dinner but this Sunday 5/5 I had the worst experience and it wasn\\'t because of the food. It was the manager Manny. I ordered 2 rolls over the phone and I knew they were busy but they guaranteed me a 20 minute wait. I was driving from Ventura to Paso Robles so I said it would be fine since I would rest for a bit while I waited. When I went in there they told me it would be another 15 minutes and I could clearly see it was busy so I understood completely. Now...15 minutes later I return and he tells me it will be another 15 minutes. By this point I was irritated because I still had a 2 hour drive and it was 8pm now. So I asked him if I could have my money back instead because it was getting late and how I wish he would have not gave me a time frame because it was not accurate whatsoever....maybe I came off rude but I was just frustrated. Manny went off to saying how he wouldn\\'t give me my money back because the roll was already in the oven, and if I wanted I could speak to the chef making it. Then he said he wasn\\'t a mind reader to know what the customers at the tables were going to order and therefore it was impossible to give me an exact time. I did not reply to him...and when I finally received my food I asked him for a small side of sriracha which to he replied \"only if you have a dollar\". I just smiled and walked out. For such a Busy and delicious place, I\\'m shocked at the poor management they have. Customer service is definitely not Manny\\'s priority, he\\'s just there for a paycheck.', \"LETS BE REAL. half off sushi...ALL THE TIME? You would be crazy to not love this place. ALL of the sushi chefs there are so nice, especially HIRO (pronounced hee-row). He is so kind and our sushi comes out to us on time, ALL the time, not to mention how amazingly neat the presentation of the sushi is.\\n\\nHibachi is great for large groups, they definitely accommodate to bigger parties, and their service is no less than when you come with one other person, or ten. They're all kind!\", 'This is the only place in town that i know of that does it Hibachi style. My tip would be to go during the daytime for more affordable pricing. I always stick to the hibachi shrimp and chicken or scallops. I also love the fried rice!', \"My husband was really excited to go to a hibachi restaurant, as it's one of his favorite dining experiences.  We were disappointed and recommend finding a different one.  Here is why,\\n\\nWe came in early for a late lunch/early dinner and service wasn't friendly.  Older hostess seemed a little annoyed seating us, even though we had called ahead.  The waitress was a bit rude and the hibachi chef wasn't very friendly and a didn't really make us feel like he wanted to be there.\\n\\nI think hibachi grills are really about the chef and interacting, we (my husband and I) both discussed after \\nthe chef walked away that we felt like the overall experience with all staff was just weird.  Everyone seemed like they really didn't want to be there that day, it was odd.  \\n\\nThis place has a great location in a busy area but I'd recommend going a little out of your way to find another one.  Maybe we just got unlucky and it's typically better then this?  Who knows but I'll check out a different place when in SB again.\", \"Writing this review to express my disappointment that they no longer feature a happy hr on beer and saki.\\n\\nSeriously I come here because the mediocre sushi is well priced and its the best mediocre sushi in town in my opinion. \\n\\nThat being said the happy hr 2 for 1 dos equis and saki was a major reason for me to frequent this place. But they did away w that. Why? No clue. \\n\\nTerrible Move.\\n\\nI may still go here for the half priced rolls - which honestly shouldn't even be called that anymore since its the normal price anyway.\\n\\nMy visits will certainly be less frequent tho due to their terrible decision of doing away w happy hr drinks. \\n\\nThanks Somethings Fishy, you just became immensely more mediocre.\\n\\nOut\", \"Well it has been a couple of years since I've been here, so things might have diminished. From what I remember though, the food was pretty darn good. \\n\\nI don't eat sushi...so can't comment about that. \\n\\nThe teppanyaki food was really good...the fried rice is second to none, the shrimp and chicken are pretty good also. I wouldn't really care if they cooked it in the back somewhere, but whatever...I don't need eyebrows anyways. \\n\\nLiving in the Bay Area now...this is one of the few places in Santa Barbara that I do miss on a regular basis.

Our grill master was very generous with the portions and I even though I had the Filet and lobster I even go to sample some of the shrimp.', \"I've only had food from the hibachi grill here and it was pretty good. Benihana-like feel. Their sushi is also half-off on weekdays. Don't go with a big group with this place. They flake with service and you don't get very high quality food since the hibachi chefs don't focus too much on flare and more on efficiency.\", \"It was my second visit to this place, and I really enjoyed their food and service again! If you haven't tried their filet mignon, you should definitely try it! Their regular streak is very good, but filet mignon is just so exceptional!! It totally worth paying extra $!! I also loved their fried rice very much. My almost four years daughter usually does not eat fried rice, but she kept eating it as it was so good :) Her another favorite was shrimp, which was very delicious too. She is already looking forward to going back to this place, and we will do for sure!\", \"A very nice eating experience. Haven't been here in a while. Used to be named Something's Fishy.  Still great quality food and excellent service.\", 'The sushi bar is amazing I go here every Tuesday after the farmers market killer sushi made fast by the guys definitely try this place out I love it', 'This is basically a bennihana.  You get a decent amount of food and a \"show\".  Good for groups.  Can get busy on the weekends with tons of UCSBers doing sake bombs.', \"My fiance' and I love our sushi and dim sum and in Santa Barbara, it is quite limiting so we were excited to see this catchy restaurant name, Something's Fishy.  But when we yelped, it didn't look good.  But that place seemed pretty busy so we decided to give it a chance.  Well, Yelp reviews were right.  We gave it 3 tries because, like I mentioned, good sushi are so limiting in this neighborhood and sometimes restaurants just have off days especially when prices are really low.  In short, our experience goes like this..\\n\\n*  The first time we ate there, it was substandard in quality.  Meaning, it didn't incite us to eat more. The waiter was punctual but the sushi maker takes off for 15 minutes and when he came back, he forgot our order so we ended up just asking for the check.  No apologies were offered.  \\n\\n*  The second time at the sushi bar, the sushi maker again forgot an order, the very first one we put in.  The second order was being made, we saw with our own eyes the sushi maker taking out a roll of raw fish from a counter height freezer behind him, and when he gave us the plate, it smelled like chlorine.  It made me nauseous and we asked for the check.\\n\\n*  The third time I braved myself and said ok, this is the last try and I know I've been generous in giving it a chance.  Took a girl friend there and after we put in the order, a big huge horse fly showed itself in the refrigerating glass case fronting us.  It was just flying around.  So, we waved the sushi maker down and pointed it out to him.  He grabbed a paper napkin and chased it down and killed it, and wiped the glass with it.  I said that's it, I'm NEVER going there again, and I must share this or my conscience won't be clear.  The manager didn't seem to care.\\n\\nYuk and so unfortunate.\", \"Came here for dinner after the urban wine trail on Saturday night. The place was packed but we managed to make a reservation the same day. We got the steak and the shrimp which was really good. \\n\\nService was also good as well. I'm not sure why the low stars but I lived in SB for 4 years and this is one of its more famous places. I would definitely check it out if in the area.\", 'The sushi bar is quick and service is friendly.  Their half off specials during the weekday are amazing!  Sitting at the bar makes for a wonderful expereince.', 'This place was 50% great, 50% bad. The problems were the service and the unexpeced mayonaise in all rolls claiming to contain \"crab\". It would be more accurate to have \"krab mayo salad\" as the ingredient. My friends and I hate mayo in sushi, so this was a big disappointment. It was difficult to get our waitress\\'s attention after placing our food orders, so it was difficult to get drink refills.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the nigiri was delicious. We happily devoured several pieces of albacore and yellowtail. The hibachi chef was entertaining and the hot food was delicious.', \"Fun place to go with a group anytime or for special occasions. The sushi is decent. I would recommend the hibachi even though it is a bit pricey. They have a pretty good menu of items to choose from and the chefs that cook at your table are very good and entertaining to watch. They do get busy so it's best to plan ahead otherwise you might have to wait for a table. The service can be slow sometimes which is not uncommon in Santa Barbara..  They have some good lunch specials and half price sushi on certain days but if sushi is what you want, there are better places to go.\", 'They do a very good hibachi Japanese show by cooking the raw food right in front of you on a large cooking plate. Depending on which cook you will get, they each do different tricks such as juggling with an egg on a knife, building and lighting up a volcano made out of onions rings, as well as diverse fire-related tricks.\\n\\nThis atmosphere gives a good entertainment for younger kids and also always a good experience to have watching the cook going crazy with your food before giving it to you once perfectly cooked. You can also ask the cook how you want him to cook your meat precisely which is appreciable. One advice I would give you is to share one of the combo with somebody as ordering too would basically give you almost the same amount of food, plus the quantities are quite large.\\n\\nAlso, they offer half off rolls on the sushi bar during the afternoon which is quite nice.\\nHowever, we regret some of the servers being a little absent minded and forgetting to bring the drinks or refills. Good place to hang out with your friends.', \"Great server and food was good. Miso soup was delicious, poke salad was yummy, but we saw our food for the hibachi sit out  in the open for at least 10 minutes which was unnerving but the food turned out really good. \\n\\nOur hibachi cook was funny and cooked most things good.  I got the shrimp and scallops. The shrimp was good but the scallops were a bit tough. My husband got the filet and chicken.

I would recommend ordering any of the fish selections, and probably their steak, but the chicken is mediocre and not all white meat. They also have an excellent calamari and jalapeno appetizer that is so tasty!', \"This restaurant is one of my favorite spots around Santa Barbara to come to when I want affordable, but still good sushi. I always order off their half priced menu. Most of the time, I order two rolls and a couple of pieces of nigiri since you can't just order sashimi. The times I have gone, the nigiri was melt in your mouth (salmon and hamachi). I give this four stars because it seems like they don't use the same quality of fish in the rolls. Love this place, will come back to try their teppanyaki.\", \"Okay I'm giving this place a 2 star only because we weren't able to share a meal here.  Cheapest was $11.95 for the chicken kabachi.  I had surgery on my stomach so I am not able to eat an entire meal on my own... and the resturant didn't want to accomodate.  We left and went to Wahoo's instead and I ate 1/2 a taco... YUM! =)\", 'The service is terrible, all the employees I have interacted with seem to have serious beef with life, and possibly the whole universe. The salmon sushi does not contain sushi-grade salmon, it is chewy and rubbery, nothing near the melty divinity that sushi deserves. The vibes are bunk, and the place looks dim and disheveled on the inside. They never specifically wronged me, but this is not a quality eating establishment, and the point of Yelp is to help people like you avoid these places. The only thing that makes this restaurant maybe worth it is the \"half-off sushi.\"', \"This review is only for the sushi:\\n\\nHmmm... I knew something was fishy when there was not ONE Asian chef, let alone worker, hah (j/k)! Anyway, we decided to go here only because it was a happy hour half-off deal.\\n\\nWe sat at the bar and the service was pretty slow with two chefs. At some point, one chef was just standing there doing nothing while the other one was busy tending to a few orders. It's possible that each chef has his own section, but I don't see why they don't help each other out. Especially since the chef was working so slowly. We ordered a little at first because we wanted to try some before getting more. This took a while to come out. We gave him the second order and I swear it took another 10 minutes for it to come out. Imagine waiting, eating a little bit, and having to wait 10 more minutes to eat a little more. I feel like in addition to the chef just being a slow worker, another reason why it takes so long is because they put all the finished rolls on one plate, instead of giving us each roll one by one after each is finished.\\n\\nThe sushi itself wasn't bad, but just okay. We did not like the rice - it had a strange texture. My boyfriend says it's most likely because they undercook the rice, then premix it with vinegar, and leave it warm to preserve it (he used to work at a Japanese market).\\n\\nIn short, the service was slow and the rice had a funny texture. Going here for sushi is good during happy hour, but I wouldn't recommend it at full price.\", \"Meh. This place wouldn't make the cut in LA but I guess when you're pretty much the only ones doing Japanese in SB, there's nothing to compare it to.\", \"We had a large group of 11 so the first place we were going to go to (Holdren's) there was an hour and a half wait.  This place was able to accomodate us with only a half hour wait so we decided to go here instead.\\n\\nIt was pretty fun doing the teppanyaki experience.  Our chef wasn't very great but it's better than Benihana's.  The onion volcano was pretty weak but he was good at flipping the bowl of rice and catching it with his spatula.  We ordered the filet mignon and scallop combination and the New York Steak and shrimp combination.  It comes with quite a bit of food.  You get miso soup, salad, fried rice, grilled vegetables, and mochi ice cream dessert.\\n\\nIt did take a long time for a chef to become available and come to our table.  We were quite hungry so maybe that's why the food tasted better.  But most of the grilled stuff came out a little overcooked.  Bill for 11 was close to $400.  It included a 20% mandatory gratuity which the waitress didn't really earn.\", 'This is the place to get your sushi fix. Half off during the week. Always bomb. The hibachi is always a sight and a good time for dinner.', 'Loved this place! Not to mention it saved the day......made reservations for my brothers graduation at another restaurant on state street which did not work out, didnt know what to do. We were going to come here in the first place but made a bad judgement call and decided to go to the other place. When things didnt pan out I immediately called to see if they could accomodate a party of 20 who was down the street. The manager was amazing, it was a saturday night, my party was large and hungry. The service was great and it was very busy as well. Over all I would definitely recommend this place and go there again. I see why its a fave of the students and visitors alike. Thanks again!', \"Great service & food. I come here all the time to get my sushi fix. I usually go to the sushi bar which is full at times, but the wait time isn't bad at all.

My friends and I would go for sushi and sake and they never carded us which is a real plus when you\\'re underage. \\n\\nThe hibachi looks great and it\\'s very reasonably priced.  However, the sushi is subpar, mediocre at best \\n\\nThere is a perennial \"happy hour\": 7 days a week, no time limitations. \\n\\nIf everything is always happy hour--half price--then it ain\\'t happy hour; it\\'s just cheap. \\n\\nThe salmon was bad and we sent it back. The sushi chef is very affable and it\\'s not his fault the fish is so so. The mackerel was by far the best, the octopus not so hot. I didn\\'t mind the tuna but I will never eat there again for sushi. It\\'s a warehouse which bears zero resemblance to its Malibu brother/sister restaurant. \\n\\nI do not know if it\\'s the same ownership or if this is now a franchise independently owned and operated, which I suspect that it is. \\n\\nIt\\'s cheap: this is the best you can say for it. And the service is just fine. \\n\\nThe cooked food looked quite good and they do have a large filet mignon and lobster special for 34.95, which if the lobster tastes good, is not bad. \\n\\nThe bargain is the ramen and it looked fine but I didn\\'t taste it. \\n\\nI think it is a THREE STAR for the cooked food/Hibachi and a 1-2 star for the sushi.\\n\\nYou can get sushi TEN times better at Whole Foods, Gelsons or Lazy Acres, which a few years ago created a sushi section with delicacies like Ikura. Something\\'s Fishy doesn\\'t even sell Ikura (salmon roe eggs, fishy bundles of wonderfulness, like pink caviar)', \"Where do I begin??? The place is filthy. The windows haven't had a genuine scrubbing ever. And then there's the wait. On a Tuesday night we were (party of five) sat down for hibachi...we were checked on every 15 to 20 minutes! We waited for one hour! No explanation was given-no apologies! We were asked in the form of a statement: You guys okay. \\n\\nAs far as the food? They are clearly chasing the tail of a comet. They charge the same if not more than Benihana's for food that is a notch better Panda Express.  The miso soup didn't have any soy in it. The fried rice didn't have any chicken in it. The vegetables were as hard as wood (not tender at all). The waitress seemed more and more afraid to approach our table as the night progressed. Our smiles had vanished and our dismay was obvious. But without opportunity to complain or appraise our service; A 17% gratuity was automatically added to our bill. \\n\\nReading this now, I realize that we could have complained but we had a long day of sight seeing and we were exhausted. We didn't research enough. But to our defense we thought a restaurant on State Street in Santa Barbara would be at least clean and ready to tend to many customers. But the thing is: There weren't tons of people in there! So they have no excuse for their lack of professionalism. I guess Soki bombs and beers are what's keeping the lights on at this place. Something is fishy indeed.\", \"The sushi rolls are amazing! This has to be my favorite sushi spot, and they are phenomenal at helping patrons with allergies!! The wait staff is always slammed so I understand why they aren't the best at observing say drink refills, but the food absolutely makes up for the service. Not only is their sushi bar the best price in town, in my opinion it tastes the best, but their hibachi station chefs are incredible!! I highly recommend checking out this spot!!\", 'This is my favorite sushi place! With the best price in this very expensive town. I always get the same roll because is delicious lol big foot roll!!!! Order if you get a chance! And Hero (hiro) is the best he always remembers my order and makes me feel at home! I definitely recommend it!!! A must go in Santa Barbara!', 'Something\\'s Fishy is our \"go to\" place! We do hibachi with Carlos for any large group celebration... Birthdays, going away parties, and employee dinners... And sit at the bar for a quick sushi lunch, as it seems they constantly have happy hour! The service is great, they make you feel like a friend, rather than a customer!', \"We went there Christmas Eve had the fillet Mignon dinner the steak was perfect came with three prawns fried rice  and vegies all was prepared at our table 20 dollars each ! we also had california roll and two others I don't know the name of but they where all half price would go there again\", \"This used to be my favorite sushi place in high school. Unfortunately, I've gone in quite a few times and have been disappointed. It's really hit or miss here. Sometimes the fish and rice are fresh, other times, like a couple days ago, its not. The fish and the rice were spoiled (ordered California and Rainbow rolls). The miso soup wasn't bad, but it wasn't delicious. I'd rather pay extra and go to Sushi Teri, Sushi GoGo, or Sushi Tyme. \\n\\nThe service on the other hand has been great every time I've come in.\", 'Went here with my sister and was seated at the sushi bar pretty much immediately which was very nice. One thing that struck me as odd was that when we tried to order a side dish from the waiter, he said we had to write it on the piece of paper we gave the sushi chef. When we wrote it on the paper for the sushi chef, he told us we had to order it from the waiter, which was frustrating cause we were simply trying to order fried rice.\\nWe got our food about 10 minutes later and it was pretty good. Not amazing. But pretty good. \\nThe reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because both me and my sister got food poisoning from it the next morning. It made me think twice about how I had seen the sushi chef not use gloves but touch all the food and multiple containers and other things without washing his hands. \\n\\nMy advice is skip the food poisoning and go somewhere else!!', 'I don\\'t care for sushi snobs that refuse to eat anything that\\'s not \"teh best.\"\\n\\nI love a great quality burger on artisanal bread with a high-quality local cheese and organic produce, but sometimes I just want a effin Big Mac with fries and a coke. \\n\\nThis is not quite the McDonalds of sushi, but it isn\\'t first rate, however, when you\\'re eating half price sushi on a tuesday afternoon, you shouldn\\'t expect it to be.\\n\\nI love the bento boxes as well, especially before they raised the prices.\\n\\nThe hibachi thing is hit or miss, depending on the chef you get, and really is kind of for tourists, so if you\\'re in to that sort of thing... have fun with it.', \"I would definitely come back.\\n\\nAlthough the chef didn't say much (which I guess is kind of a bummer for teppenyaki) but my meal was delicious!  My chicken was cooked just right and the shrimp was awesome.\\n\\nI would like to try the sushi, especially since it's half off M-Th.\", \"Either this chef sucks or the rules he has to follow make him suck. This place has no type of good spicy sauce. They barely put oil or butter on anything. The rice was the worst I've ever tasted also had no bacon in it. This place missed the mark today. I will tell everyone how much it sucks. Never again. The only up side was that the egg rolls were good.\", \"Loved this place! Nice setting, fun and friendly staff and of course great food. Only thing I didn't like was their iced tea I had to sent it back other than that great place will go again. Oh, best fried rice ever.\", 'Great food! We had steak and calamari, it comes with salad, fried rice and vegetables. Wonderful show from the chief while cooking on the stove in front of us! Highly recommend!', 'California roll & Philadelphia Roll (no rice) with a side house salad. Bomb!!!!! With veggie spring rolls. This place is a must especially with half price sushi sun-thur', \"So yummy! They cooked up one of the best New York steaks my boyfriend and I have ever had! We also got the shrimp, and it was just as great. We loved watching the chef make our meal right in front of us, especially the fried rice! A surprising favorite of ours was the spicy edamame- whatever sauce they used was perfect. I definitely recommend coming here, it was our first time and now it's a favorite- we even want to come back tomorrow!. Delicious.\", \"The only hibachi style restaurant in Santa Barbara and it is most definitely worth a visit! Great service and some of the best chicken and shrimp I've ever had! Its a great place to have a dinner party and the chefs who come out to make your food do it right in front of you!\", \"Had first and last dinner here last night.  I don't see this place lasting the competitive Santa Barbara restaurant market long.  The food is low quality, the cost is high. I had scallops that looked and tasted like poker chips.  Notice that the positive reviews are about the half price lunch sushi, or they were treated nicely at the door. I can't help but to wonder how 5 stars is warranted because someone said hello.  The Groupon is a scam, as mentioned in other yelp posts.  Pay $36.50 for a $35 discount--REALLY?\", \"This is the second time I have been here. The first time was three years ago. I remember the food getting really cold before I really had a chance to eat since I was watching the chef cook. I guess I just thought it was because our table was by the door. \\nSo after three years I went back because a friend was visiting. The chef was pretty cool and the food was pretty good except for the bean sprouts. It was like flavor-less. The waitress forgot our white rice so even after all the food was cooked I was just sitting there asking where the hell is the rice. My friend had to ask the chef and the other people that was sitting with us were kind of pissed too. The chef had to ask the waitress for our rice. So that kind of sucked.\\nBenihana is way better. The soup at benihanas is def more delicious because here at Something's Fishy they pretty much just give you miso soup. Food is alright but you would get more at benihanas.\", \"I was very happy with my visit to Something's Fishy ! The service was excellent and they answered all of our questions. Came on a Thursday and I must say that the prices were unbeatable. Sunday-Thursday happens to be half off sushi ! I paid $19.00 for 3 sushi rolls, the most delicious fried rice, and 2 sodas. The sushi was really good, and it was a cozy little spot on State Street. Came for lunch, but I heard that dinner is also really good as well.\", 'Consistently throughout the years quality fresh food prepared by experts. Delicious, entertaining, and dis I mention it tastes good? Try the scallops!', 'Food was extremely enjoyable, ambience of the restaurant was great. The salmon roll felt a bit fishy, but otherwise all the other rolls were great quality.', 'This place is awesome! The food is great and the service is excellent! I just had dinner with my family and extended family as soon as we arrived had great welcoming our server Cassandra was so nice and sweet did such a good job taking care of us and our children she was very attentive to what we needed and made us feel comfortable. Everyone was great!', \"Use to go here all the time in college for the sushi specials and it was great. Came back after 3 years and it has gone downhill. The new sushi chefs are not as good and not as sociable.  The hibachi made me sick because the food wasn't cooked all the way. The steak had no flavor and the rice was way too salty. On top of that I was charged 3 times was I should have paid! I called to try to resolve the situation the the female manager was super rude. Not helpful at all and did not apologize. Be careful in the future because aparently if you split the check they charge one of the cards full price and then void it (they don't tell customers this). However, in my case the transaction was not voided and I was charged the full amount while my other two friends were charged the correct amount. I will not be going back.\", 'I ordered menu of Hawaiian poke salad. \\nIt is many seafoods in with tuna and seaweed salad. It was a delicious. \\nHibachi steak of the chef made the best of taste for grilled rice and beef steak. \\nI saw New menu. Seafood rolled sushi wrapped in soy paper is recommend. \\nCostumer service is a very very good.', 'Quality has gone down over the years.  Service was bad, too.  The chef did not say a word.  Plus, the chef was wearing a headband with Japanese word \"Japan [Ni-Pon]\" upside down.  No one understands Japanese at this \"Japanese\" restaurant?  Unfortunately, this is the only Tepan-yaki style restaurant in Santa Barbara, I think.', \"Despite seeing all the other reviews that say this place isn't good I decided to give it a shot anyway. The food was very bland and the service was terrible. Everyone there is rude and they don't care about you. It took a long time for everything and our chef didn't do any tricks and he didn't talk to us. Would not recommend this place very bad save your money.\", \"We sat at one of then hibachi areas with our group of 7.   5 of us ordered the hibachi and shared, it was nice.  We had the shrimp dinner, the chicken, the lobster & filet,  etc.  We also had a round of sake bombs.  Most excellent.  It was a fun experience and the food was good.   \\n       It was Saturday evening, we had a reservation for a little before 7pm.  It took maybe 5-10 minutes to be seated, not too bad.  You cannot go there and expect to be in and out fast, it is entertainment and takes awhile.  I'd say by 830/845 we were just working on our soup and salad (comes with some of the dinners).   Our final bill was over 100$, but reasonable for group size and items ordered.  Delicious.  Could be the alcohol speaking, but I don't think so.\", 'I see a lot of reviews about the size of the place, I actually felt it was large for a sushi place. I guess I\\'m used to the small sushi bars that are in the Valley...Anyways walking in, I noticed that the inside had a semi-fancy dim lit ambiance.\\n\\nIn terms of service: Our waitress was very nice,polite, and helpful. \\n\\nFood: We decided to indulge in the half-price menu: I had an eel& cucumber roll and a crab roll. I\\'m not so sure that the crab roll had crab or krab, kinda sketch. I liked the eel roll but they went skimpy on the eel sauce (which is my fav). To be honest, the sushi seemed a bit dry and not too authentic (almost like those prepackaged ones you find at albertsons).\\n\\nMy friend had the \\'Something\\'s Fishy roll\" which tastiness gave me some hope\\n\\nI\\'ll probably visit here again for the experience and maybe some pre-drinking munchies before hitting Sandbar ;).', \"My wife and I were desperately looking for ayce sushi in\\nSanta Barbara.

Service was ok nothing special. overall it's well worth it to make this a staple eatery of state street for us.\", 'The sushi is just ok. They slice them way to thick and none of the 7 rolls we ordered stayed together.\\n*** this is an update. I changed from 3 starts to 1 star. I am thoroughly disgusted with this place. Great location and nice staff but food and even the water was gross.', 'We love and enjoy to eat here. The hibachi grill is alway great and less greasy. Love their half price special on Sushi items from Mon to Thu. The only things that bother us that the waitstaff kinda in a rush to take order without giving us minute to read at the menu or giving us any recommend on their specialty.

Either sitting at the grill for a show or eating with friends at the bar, I love this place!', 'Went for lunch. Half price rolls was great, so I am almost willing to overlook the Horrible service we recieved. The waitress realized that she overlooked us at the bar, so she sent the bus boy. He was basically our server. I made sure he got the tip. :) I do wish the guys making the rolls would engage us in conversation more then themselves in Spanish. That was kind of a bummer too. I will still go back because the sushi was cheap and yummy!', \"This is my favorite restaurant. You can enjoy not only the delicious food but fire cooking at your table.

You can most certainly find better Hibachi elsewhere in SB. Not only was our steak over cooked, but our shrimp was rubbery. Likewise, the service here is absolutely horrendous. Part of our order was forgotten about (it wasn\\'t even busy) and the server (Megan) had a \"Don\\'t bother me\" attitude throughout our entire dinning experience. Looking around, I noticed the staff was busy fraternizing with each other with little actual attention being paid to the customer (I guess it\\'s the theme of this place). At the end of our meal, we had to sit even longer for our server to bring the check while she sat up against the wall and looking around aimlessly. \\n\\nDo yourself a favor and don\\'t even bother with this place.  I will not be back.\\n\\nUPDATE: When leaving the restaurant, I unknowingly left a recent purchase behind on my table. I go back into the restaurant only to be greeted by our Server (Megan) who gave me the most UNBELIEVABLE attitude ever. The busser found my package and gave it to me with a smile.

The fish (sashimi) reeks of oldness, and you would think everything would be fresh since they're literally a ten minute walk from the ocean.\\n\\nSteak was overcooked in the hands of a mediocre cook. Reinforces the fact the Bennihanna's is boss. Did no cool magic tricks, onion volcano, or even musical utensil show, I mean COME ON!

After walking up and down State St. looking at all the dining options we finally settled on Something's Fishy after I gave up my bid for the Italian restaurant across  the street. \\nThis place is a teppan and sushi restaurant, sort of in the vein of Benihana. The atmosphere is much more casual and the prices are a bit more affordable. We sat at a communal grill table with two other couples and awaited the arrival of the teppan chef and the server. The service was speedy and accurate and the chef was a jovial cool guy, flipping the shrimp tails into his hat and making jokes. We ordered fried rice with no egg, which had to be prepared in the kitchen in back which I thought as unusual. The rice was way over salted. The chicken and steak were both delicious but my boyfriend didn't care for the shrimp he ordered. I felt in the end that I would've preferred the Italian place that I was originally interested in. No one can really compare to Benihana, bottom line.\", 'Excellent service very clean great food we were party of 15 people and they served us Verry quickly we loved the chef very funny I do recommend to friends for sure', \"Best sushi in Santa Barbara!!

Our food was delicious the scallops and filet mignon were perfectly cooked to medium rare like we requested. The salmon was a bit overdone but it was still tasty.

Despite being regulars, service from the wait staff was ALWAYS poor. The sushi chefs were always on top of it however, so hats off to you guys. Food quality constantly changed. Sometimes it would taste good, other times it would taste bland. Food prepared in the kitchen often tasted frozen, dry, and fried rice was clearly made in bulk, reheated and served. To top it all off, I discovered roaches crawling around one night, and ever since this place has been off limits for me.', 'Best hibachi and sushi in town!

The food is great, and great customer service. This is a perfect place for families, and even dates. If you are not familiar with this form of dining...they cook the food in front of you. It is very entertaining and is a pleasure to watch. The only downside is you have to sit right next to others in a bar-like table fashion, and you can sometimes feel a little claustrophobic. If you do not like sitting next to people you don't know, then this place may not be for you. \\n\\nBeing that Hibachi Steak House is located on the busy State Street, parking may be a challenge.

Most dished ranged from 2-3 dollars (except for some specialty rolls) and it was pretty good sushi. The one thing that kept me from rating 5 stars was that I wrote down one order for egg cake and I never got it. Instead I was given the order that was listed above the egg cakes, the mackerel.  The mackerel was good but the chef didn't say anything about changing my order. I could have been allergic to mackerel.

We came in for dinner this past Monday night at 6pm, and we're pleasantly surprised to see that the restaurant wasn't too busy since we were all very hungry.  Actually only 2 other hibachi tables (out of over 8-9) had occupants prior to us sitting down, however, we didn't end up ordering until 6:50...for reasons I still can't quite comprehend.  With 4 kids (one being a pre-toddler), the speed at which dinners out flow is of utmost importance for larger families, and Something's Fishy sure took their sweet time in that department.  \\n\\nC'mon Something's Fishy...you're better than this.\", \"Kimberly Cameron, Valencia, CA\\nI'm really surprised that Something's Fishy only got an overall 3/5 star rating. I love this place!! The Hibachi is excellent, and I've always enjoyed the sushi too!! My favorite Hibachi meal: Scallops and Rib Eye, and I love the salad, fried rice, soup, and veggies!!

What makes it more exciting are the tricks and interaction the chef may have with you. Some tricks you can search up are, juggling an egg on their spatula and cracking it with the edge. Throwing a spatula, flipping shrimp into customers' mouths. On top of all this, the chef is generally happy, cracking jokes, like a performer on stage. \\n\\nThe problem with this restaurant is every time I go here, I get the same chef and he says hello and cooks the food. He lights some onions on fire later on in the performance and he taps his spatula but that's about all he does. He honestly doesn't look happy being there, and I completely understand.\\n\\nThe food itself, is okay and the servers are excellent. I think the prices here are fair and I usually add a little extra tip, we all gotta make a living.\\nIf you've never been to a hibachi restaurant, this environment can still be quite entertaining.

We haven't really gone out to since this whole COVID 19 pandemic started and my girlfriend recently got surgery and last night she was finally up for going out to get some food so it was supposed to be a nice dinner date. Upon arriving I could tell they were on the busier side of most places around. There was a table right in front of the restaurant but we requested something by the heaters since it was starting to get a bit cold. The only table available by a heater seated 6. We confirmed it wouldn't be a problem since it was just my partner and I. We were reassured it would be no problem. So we sat down and looked up the online menu and started to decide what we would order. We then noticed a few people on staff kept walking around looking at us. It happened a few times. We started to feel weird thinking it was because there was just two of us sitting at this 6 people table. Turns out we were right. There was a group of 3 that they wanted to seat but options were limited. We got asked if it would be a problem if we moved, we agreed as long as it was near a heater and they said they had a table clearing up near one. Then a few minutes later the same guy came and said it wasn't a problem we could stay where we were. We asked if they were sure, we didn't have a problem moving but were once again reassured it was fine. We then noticed the group of 3 must work there or be friend of the staff because they were quickly brought a table out from inside and their drink order was taken. By this time it had been 30 or so minutes and the only time we were approached was to be asked to move. We waited a few more minutes and no one came. We noticed the groups of 3 was already ordering and we hadn't even had water brought out. We flagged down a waiter and expressed our frustration. He said he would be back and after another 5 minutes we decided to get up and leave.

Lucky for him, I was down the street and walked over and asked at the hostess stand what his name was, and he said \"Miguel\" I asked for the \"manager\" and he said he was the manager. I let him know that he had POOR customer service. I told him I had just called and he placed me on hold and hung up on me, and he said, \"fine write your yelp\" so HERE I AM.

I'm sitting here, starving, and it will probably be another hour until the hibachi chef gets to me. \\n\\nA tip from to the owners- make sure your food can be served in a timely manner so yelpers don't write cranky reviews when their blood sugar is low and they are starving.\", 'Disappointed in the food.

Once our cook arrived, he was professional and prepared our meal right before our eyes, much to our delight. He also named and explained the usage for each sauce, which was a nice gesture on his part.\\n\\nHibachi is an experience that cannot soon be forgotten. I'll definitely be visiting this establishment again in the near future.\", \"During non-COVID times this is the only place in town to get Hibachi. However, we regularly make our way here for the sushi. They have a great selection of rolls and the prices are very reasonable.

Perhaps the best thing about the place is their incredibly friendly service. Head sushi chef Hiro is a particularly fantastic guy and I have never had a poor experience here.

The hibachi was awesome and the sushi was great. Everything tasted fresh and and cooked to order. Would come back.', \"Went for the hibachi but started at the sushi bar. The four sushi items I had were tasty and well prepared but they were all a bit too close to room temperature. It seems their sushi prep area isn't cold enough. Not a comforting feeling. Four of us had the hibachi: steak and shrimp, steak only and chicken only. You get three or four shrimp regardless of what you order and roughly twice that if you get the shrimp and steak. Soup was tasty, followed by a nice little salad. However, the comments about the fried rice are true -- the chef sprinkles WAY too much salt on it while its being mixed with the veggies. Most likely it also contains MSG to kick up the flavor. They also drop a generous amount of butter on the steak, chicken and anything that doesn't move. Result: too rich and salty. The yellow squash and bean sprout vegetable side is tasty. Steak is carved up and is tender. The chicken is a very cheap cut of breast, thin, fairly small; not plump at all and more gristle than necessary. The entree prices are fair but the quality of the steak and chicken could definitely be taken up a notch. Everyone commented on how full and bloated they felt after dining. Bottom line: The veggies and meats are heavy, overly salty and not fresh, light and a gourmet experience by any stretch. Its a shame because with a bit more attention and modified cooking techniques this could be a great go to habachi in the heart of the tourist area. Wine by the glass prices are ridiculous, as other reviewers have noted.\", 'This place used to be called \"somethings fishy\", with decent sushi and hibachi, however they have changed their name and raise their prices. They used to have \"half-price sushi  with good to mediocre quality sushi, But recently they have raise their prices, and not raise the quality of their sushi. I would not go here based on the prices, I would go to a higher quality sushi place, that has better sushi for the same prices.

They start you off with a lot of appetizers which will basically fill you up before you even begin eating the main course meal. That is probably the only downside but I guess that is Japanese tradition or something like that. \\n\\nOtherwise their food is good and their service is average. Kind of a small area and you can just feel others around you. Very dark as well especially at night. I guess that's how the atmosphere is as the name may suggest.\", \"This place was so good to me in college. \\n\\nCame here at least once a month on a weekday beacuse Monday through Thur the sushi would be half price.  EVERYTHING on the sushi roll menu was half off.. not just a limited menu like most places. \\n\\nI celebrated my 21st bday here and got a table with Tepanyaki- where they entertain you with making the food.

We waited 25 minutes to be seated- our choice but once we were seated it was almost an hour before the chef came over. When he came, he was nice but obviously rushed through everything and he was exhausted. There was not an option of chicken breast-it was thighs- I assumed breast. No yum yum sauce- should have asked. Saw reviews used to be good but definitely a downward trend. They were apologetic and offered the table free edamame and California rolls.

It was not much of a show, but still fun to be served food right off the grill in a group before a chef.\\n\\nFor dinner guests select meats that come with vegetables, miso soup, salad, shrimp flambé, and white or fried rice. Three dipping sauces are provided as well. The individual portions are not large, but everything combined is a fairly large meal. \\n\\nI had chicken and New York steak.\\n\\nShrimp flambé was the first meat to come out. Everyone received three de-shelled, medium sized shrimps. It was lacking in flavor.\\n\\nThe chicken came out dry and not very flavorful. Beware it was all dark meat too if that's not your thing. The steak though was cooked perfectly rare as I requested, tender and juicy. I really enjoyed it.\\n\\nThe manager was very kind and polite from the moment I walked in until I left. I like that he interacted with guests. Also, the chefs stacking the onions to form a flaming volcano were pretty snapchattable. More tricks would be nice.\\n\\nI recommend the teppan if you live in the area and want to try an interactive dining experience; small parties will be seated with strangers, so it takes a little longer to be seated and to order. It's great for a birthday.\\n\\nAlso, locals tell me this is the place to get sushi on a budget: half off Monday through Thursday.\", \"Came here for my friend's birthday .

The food was also not bad. The service however was the worst part, took about 20 minutes to get a refill on a water and the whole thing just seemed very disorganized. Another part I found kind of frustrating was the fact that none f the food was introduced so we didn't really have any idea what exactly we were eating.\\nIf you're going for the Groupon meal offer don't expect an actual stake because the portions are going to be a lot smaller than in the pictures. Nevertheless, overall the meal was a lot of food so it did not really matter for me.\", 'Just okay. This place has a weird set up everything is out in the open.

I don't go out to eat sushi much, but here I will always order a roll or two whether I'm sitting at the sushi bar or teppan tables. It's just that good. Their mustard sauce in my opinion is the best with steak, ANY steak. I don't use A1 sauce anymore unless I'm at some other American steak house and that's all I'm left with.

The hibachi is also a fun experience, definitely worth a try!', \"I have been coming here for awhile now and at first it seemed great. Service from our regular waitress, Jordan was outstanding! The food was delicious and prepared in a timely manner. However, with more visits I frequented, the food was sometimes hit or miss. Some days the food seemed fresh, other times it didn't taste as good. Service has tanked recently from servers, whether it is busy or not. Maybe it's lack of training, or discipline, I'm not sure. Our server would take a long while to get us drinks, requests, and taking our order teppan order when sat at the sushi bar.\\n\\nSome hosts and hostesses don't always look too happy and don't give a warm welcome. I get it, you might be having a bad day, or you're upset, you're tired, whatever. But personal issues should he pushed aside while you are working and you should try and perform your best. The sushi chefs however are ALWAYS outstanding. They are the ones who have helped me decide to give a higher rating. They are polite, and fast with orders.\\n\\nSummed up, I would still visit here and keep giving this place a chance. They are not bad, but they are not the best either.

Can't lose!\", \"I have been coming here for years.  It has changed ownership and names over the years.  I am not sure who is the current ownership but I had a bad experience..  The sushi bar has great deals and customer service.  Today however, I tried to order togo teriyaki dinner and they don't offer it togo so I was offered to order teriyaki chicken for 7.50. So I did.  When I go home it was a packet of mushrooms wrapped in a tiny bit of tin foil so it was difficult to notice any chicken. When I called because I didn't see any chicken,  I spoke with management who was rude and told me his staff did pack the chicken.  This was an embarrassment to their establishment that they would sell this dish.  This was smaller than a salad dressing portion.  Live and learn!  I hope they change management again!\", 'Food was good. State St is closed right at this corner so there is outdoor dining. The wait was not too bad for a Saturday night.  The steak was cooked perfectly. The food did get a little cold, but  the place was super busy and they were doing all they could under the circumstances. The server was polite, she did forget a couple things we had asked for (small things, sauces), but she also mentioned she was new. Def a great place for dinner, we would eat here again.', \"I've only eaten here for the rolls, and I find it reasonable.  It's a great place to get half off sushi, but not life changing.  Although I do have to say that their featured Homare Strawberry Nigori is something to try.  Not sure if something milky should be combined with fancy rolls, but if you stick to nigiri or sashimi it'll be fine.\", 'Ahhh this place never disappoints I absolutely love the food here. I always order the crunchy roll and Mexican roll. My fave, hibachi anyone? The guys always put a great show. Bring your family here there going to love it.', \"Manuel the manger is terrible at customer service. He was condescending toward me and was very unprofessional, even laughed at me. A managers job is to be courteous, helpful, service-oriented, this manager is not. Anytime I've ordered through grubhub and there needs to be a price adjustment, the restaurant staff has automatically charged me for this or they have called me to clarify- Manuel did neither. He should learn how to navigate grubhub more efficiently or don't offer grubhub service to customers. Had your menu been accurate, had you offered a side of fried rice instead of just white rice, I would not have been forced to modify my order in the first place. There is an option to upgrade a side of rice if you order a meal, but not just as a side. Manuel told me this was my fault. Congratulations, Hibachi Steak House, because you hired a person who clearly does not exemplify a service-oriented professional, you have lost a very loyal customer of the past 30 years. All he needed to do was at least apologize, instead he laughed at me.\", \"Not a super luxurious place, but a great stop for a quick lunch and dinner. The only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars is because of the wait staff. Not sure if it's from lack of staff or lack of training, but they always look overwhelmed. One waitress in particular however, asked and gave us our drinks and then never bothered to come back to the bar until we had a busser go fetch her for us. Again, she never came back for refills or to check on us, and the next time we saw her is when we asked for the bill. Unfortunately I did not catch her name, but she tends to talk among her coworkers instead of working, management should get on this. The food is pretty good, the sushi chefs are always polite and on point. I visit here at least once a week, and I can say the sushi itself tastes fresh a majority of the time, and the chicken and beef teriyaki are pretty tasty! The fried rice however is not consistent, sometimes it's not cooked properly or it is overcooked. I still give a 4/5 for the sushi chefs and the food. Please raise the standards on the floor staff, and you guys are solid!\", \"First time eating here. Called ahead and made a reservation. I recommend doing that as they do get really busy. You can choose if you want sushi or Teppanyaki. We elected for the Teppanyaki and it was delicious! Shared a table with 4 other people. Was a fun experience and was worth the price! I ordered the Hibachi steak and scallops with fried rice. Highly recommend it! Also ordered the hot sake which I also suggest trying!! Give this place a try you won't regret it!\", \"So disappointing.  Prices were high but I don't mind if the food is awesome. Vegetable dinner plate was bland. Tofu had almost no seasoning. Halibut was expensive and it had been frozen beforehand. It was also not a large piece of halibut, it was small slices. Appetizer of vegetable spring rolls were mediocre and did not arrive until dinner was served. Server never brought out rice that should have been withy dinner. Also, they weren't completely knowledgeable about food content. I asked for no dairy but the salad dressing was a dairy product. I'm used to that and it's okay, not every server understands how important that can be.  It seemed like a great place from the outside but maybe it just looked that way because State St is a touristy attractive place. Next time we will ask around to find out where the locals go.\", \"FRANCISCO IS THE WORST CHEF EVER! I've been going to Something Fishy for over 10 years now, and conservatively I'd say that I've been there at least 45 times for dinner, likely much more. I've had Francisco at least a dozen times and have ALWAYS hated the finished product, and his personality stinks. If you frequent here like I do, you know that Francisco doesn't do ANY entertainment at all, aside from the brief volcano in the middle. He rushes to cook the food so he can move on to the next table, inevitably to make more in tips, and tonight my husband's chicken wasn't cooked all the way through. Disgusting! After only cooking the rice for approximately 3 min he started spooning it into the bowls to serve it so I kindly asked if he could cook mine a little longer off to the side as he finished cooking the remaining dishes. He was downright rude, and then to make a point he pretty much burnt the rice and refused to cook anything else until my husband finally demanded that he stop trying to burn it and hand it over already! The whole time he was cooking it he had a crappy look on his face and was acting so childish.  What a joke! The rest of my food was hardly cooked and he was incredibly rude the rest of the experience. I will demanded a different chef IF I visit again. He's always been a nightmare of a chef, but tonight he crossed the line. Not to mention that I had my 2 year old daughter with me who adores the fire shows and the tricks with the spatulas, but he didn't do any, and never does. My poor kiddo was so bummed. Why do they keep that guy employed there?! Management, if you are reading this, please monitor his output and offer remedial training! You are losing customers! \\nMy dinner was horrible tonight, like it is every single time he is the chef. \\nThank God for our waitress who was wonderful! I wish I had caught her name. If it wasn't for her I would have left while Francisco was trying to burn our rice. \\nOh! And to top it off, while in the middle of cooking another chef came over and they took a shot of alcohol while he was (hardly) cooking for us. How unprofessional. This place is becoming a joke. It use to be much better when the original owner, the father of the current owner, was still managing the place. It's falling apart now.\", 'It was an all around horrible experience. I was there with a group for a birthday party. They sat us 45 minutes late for our reservation and by the time our chefs finally arrived, it was late and they wanted to leave so they rushed through cooking our food and left out all of the tricks and stunts that is part of the whole hibachi experience. What should have been a happy fun filled night was full of frustration. Why rush us when it was their fault we sat late in the first place? I used to love this place before the ownership changed. But I will never be back.', 'The portion for the price is ridiculous. \\n\\nYou get more vegetables deep fried than the actual entree.', 'Over cooked steak that came out cold. Fried rice tasted like it was microwaved. Then to top it off wait staff was rude and inattentive. So not worth the money, better off going to Benihana.', \"My friends and I came here for dinner. I found out that 'Something Fishy' had changed their name to 'Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar'. When we arrived here, no one greeted us even though there was a waitress by the door who saw us. The wait wasn't too long since there were seats available. When I saw the menu, I noticed this place raised their sushi price. The food is okay since they're very plain, and the fish doesn't taste fresh. The service was okay since the waiter offered what we needed.\", \"The ginger was dry. Rolls were okay, nothing spectacular. Came during happy hour but of course the specialty rolls are regular price. The experience wasn't good because they had multiple spiders. One was on the (dirty) menu, one came hanging from the ceiling, and one crawled up on the bar. Aside of that I had to swat my plate the whole time because of gnats. They actually landed in my drink and kept trying to attack my food.\", \"I love the cooking show, the chef's are very talented! The food is always delicious. You get your money's worth! I recommend trying something fishy! :)\", 'Best sushi I have ever had for an unbelievable reasonable price . Jorge made music for our mouths. We are so happy we decided to stop here during our road trip. We will definitely stop here every time we make this trip !', \"I understand why people would like the prices here, but they sacrificed all other aspects of a decent restaurant. Including quality of food and especially service. I am allergic to many things and they did not really seem to care or listen when I told them, which made me concerned that there may have been things in the rolls that could have made me very sick. \\nWhen we received our food it seemed as if the sushi chefs have perfected the art of making fresh sushi appear as if it had been made the day before and left to sit under fluorescent lights. When we noticed one roll had a topping on it that was not listed on the menu that I was allergic to, when we alerted the chef they seemed annoyed with us and refused to remake or replace the roll with something else. After this final slight, we asked for all of our uneaten food to be boxed and went to get Italian food up the road. The sushi was later consumed as high munchies, and it still tasted like fishy paste. Something's fishy is right, but not in the way you would like.\", \"I can't comment on the steak or the service, because I only rolls during the Covid 19 panic. The gentleman who took my order was very kind for the brief interaction we had. Given the look of the place, the large amount of workers inside, and the grub hub drivers waiting outside to grab the orders I felt confident the rolls would be good. I didn't bother Yelping. Lesson learned. I ordered the two special rolls for the day, The crunchy roll and the orange fire roll. One was $12 and the other was 14. The ingredients sounded like a good combination, although they touted the Fire roll as being really hot, which is a bonus for my tastes. I brought the rolls home and they were fairly sized so the portion was adequate, but once my family and I actually ate them, disappointment reared it's ugly face. The quality of the ingredients was severely lacking. The crunch roll seemed like they used stale crumbs, the rice was almost doughy, and left your mouth coated with a dry doughy feeling which took from the other ingredients that should have saved the meal. The same issue with the rice went for the fire roll, only it was even more disappointing as it had salmon in the center and a beautiful slice of tuna on top. But looks can be deceiving, the sushi was actually not very fresh and it couldn't save the day, rather it only added to the sad meal. I'm not an avid sushi eater, but I've had it at least a hundred times in my life, and this was easily the worst I've ever had from an actual sushi restaurant (buffets and grocery stores don't count). If you're in the mood for rolls, keep rolling for your own sake.\", 'Love love love this place. We order so many dishes and all of them were so delicious. Service is just amazing. Our server suggest me plum wine which was good. I highly recommend this place.', \"Sadly to say my last visit didn't go well. Ordered food that was suppose to be vegan and ended up getting shrimp and i got sick for two days. I decided to come back today. Feb 9th and ordered food that was once again...lined with raw fish. This time I will take some responsibility for it because I didn't speak directly with the chef but with the host who translated my request for FISH free food.\", 'Just stopped by for a last minute anniversary dinner and everything was so great and yummy! Sushi rolls are good and reasonably priced, NY steak and salmon were so great and juicy! Service was also great, our server was really attentive. Would go back!', \"Something's Dirty - very dirty, and not very good. I don't know what it was three years ago when I wrote my first review for Something's Fishy -- perhaps I was jaded by my minuscule graduate student budget or maybe the food and atmosphere at Something's Fishy were better back then. Whether the scales have fallen from my eyes or things have taken a turn for the worse, the quality of the food and cleanliness of the restaurant are seriously lacking. \\n\\nWhen we sat down, our countertop was sticky with a what appeared to be weeks of accumulated soy sauce, dust, hair and who knows what else on it. The paper menus had soy sauce spilled on them. The sushi chef was scratching his face and picking at his nose then grabbing a handful of sushi rice to prepare a roll. It just wasn't a good scene. The curtain that you have to walk through to get to the bathrooms looks like you could catch an infectious disease as you pass it - just nasty. \\n\\nThat said, I loved this place for the half price sushi when I was on a serious budget. These days, I won't be returning. Everything about it repulses me down to the smog ridden ceilings, dingy decor and nasty after taste of the sushi. The customer service is absent-minded and inattentive. However, I understand this can be a decent sushi alternative if you're looking for a bargain and don't mind comprising quality and cleanliness. 50 off sushi all day, every day.\", \"On my wedding day we walked in with a party of 25, we sat down only to find cockroaches crawling out of the grill, we had to walk out at that point very sad  considering this was my childhood favorite place . I won't ever be able to eat there again.\", \"I absolutely love this place. I have been a patron for many years and have never had a bad experience. So many places that try to entertain often can't provide the quality food - but this place does! It is so much fun and so yummy. \\n\\nPS I love their hibachi steak and chicken...!\", 'This is where you go if you want sushi on the cheap. Quality is basic but \"good.\" The teppen is tasty. It\\'s not a gourmet experience but it is edible and reasonably priced Sun - Thurs. The fried rice is fantastic!', \"Service at this place was truly top notch. I mean they didn't rush to be friendly when I walked in but eventually it got better. I guess I'm not too picky! Seriously though the waiter was incredible and obviously local because he seemed to know about everything. I don't think I've had an individual experience with a server in my time in Santa Barbara so this is very refreshing. \\n\\nSushi was good, like good, not unforgettable. The half-off thing helps bring a lot of value to the sushi, you definitely feel like you get your money's worth unlike a lot of sushi restaurants here. \\n\\nBathroom is pretty decent, I don't know why I feel like this should be included but I saw someone else complain about it being dirty. There was a guy doing his hair or something though...strange.\\n\\nSomething's Fishy is really a terrible name in my opinion but the restaurant is good!\", 'SUPERB, food! I love the layout of the Resturant. Great Sushi bar for lunch, great staff. Need I Say more? A tad pricey but well Worth it.', 'Been coming to this place for years with my family. However in the last 2 years its taken a turn for the worse. They have changed their recipes and it is not for the better. I used to come every year for my birthday because I loved the taste of their chicken steak and shrimp but now I choose to go else where. Also the staff used to make be a lot friendlier now seems likely they are more task driven then taking care of their customers', \"My son and I really enjoyed our dinner here! My son compared it to BeniHana but said this place was better and I agree! The price is perfect it not too pricey. My son got the New York steak dinner plate and I got the New you're steak with salmon and the portions were perfect! We also had sushi rolls for our appetizer and those tasted very fresh! I'm very pleased with this spot!  I highly recommend\", \"Came tonight after purchasing a Groupon, I wasn't sure what to expect as it was my first hibachi style dining experience. I was pleasantly surprised! The service was good and food was very good. We ordered two hibachi steak dinners with scallops and fried soft shell crabs to start and love it all. The only thing was we expected a bit more showmanship from the chef, but he still did a good job. The restaurant itself could go for an update and perhaps a deep cleaning but overall it's a nice dining environment. I would come in again and I recommend giving it a try- especially with the Groupon.\", \"DON'T EAT HERE The worst hibachi ever!!!! The waitress was so sweet but it was all out of her control. Francisco the chef was terrible...., not a smile,no conversation, no show.  The manager said that's just the way he is, WTF??? Fire him.  I had my food cooked in the back since they couldn't cook without butter.... everything was all over cooked and another lady at the table was the same (cooked with Francisco).  I said I wasn't paying for the cooked items, mind you I had $13 In shitty sashimi.. the waiter had the audacity to say that I ate the shrimp.  Hello, I hadn't eaten since breakfast. The shrimp were over cooked crap. I will never go back there. There are better restaurants around.\", \"Friday is super busy for State Street and while we were asking this place looked pretty good. We were sat pretty quickly but it took a while for our initial service. Service staff was really good and friendly after that. For dinner, I ordered the New York strip steak and shrimp hibachi with fried rice substitution combo (which came with a small salad). Although dinner was good, for the price, I was pretty disappointed with the entire meal including presentation ($30- not including tax or tip). It wasn't your typical fried rice plate (no eggs or veggies other than onion) flavored with salt and pepper), my steak had a ton of fat on it, and the shrimp wasn't flavored well enough.\", \"omnomnom sushi! this place is awesome, yummy, fresh sushi and extremely reasonable. Half off weekday sushi bar is where it's at errybody. mmm my mouth is waterin' just thinking about it :)\", \"We went to this restaurant on 9/1/19. Party of 8. We had a 30 wait time. No problem.\\n\\nWe were seated at the grill and the grill was filthy. While we sat and waited. We saw customers come and go. It was confusing as we had been waiting an hour at this point. I must point out that after the first 15 min of waiting, we got our drinks, then 10 min later we received soup and then salad. As we waited we saw the table at the front window get new customers, meal prepared and saw them leave. Finally we questioned the waitress and she said we would be next. Eventually, our chef came to our grill. I must point out that each station has 2 grills which services 8 customers. Well the chef came and the customers at the grill in front of us within our stink was beginning to get their grill started. I was not happy and got up to find the manager when the chef looked around and turned to face us. He cleansed the filthy grill with dried up sauce and old rice and left from previous. \\n\\nMost chefs do not talk at all. Not even a welcome. There were minimal knife and food tricks. Meanwhile, in the back of the restaurant they were fortunate to get a chef that talks and did the whole show. Our service was sloppy at best. The chef wasn't clear or orders. To the benefit of a friend who only ordered shrimp and filet mignonette, she received not only that but lobster, salmon and scallops. (Yes, I wish I got some of her mistakes.) \\n\\nI don't recommend this place. It lacks customer service (not attentive at all), chefs do not talk and lack providing the whole hibachi experience. Was odd.\\nTaste of food is ok.\\n\\nI knew I should've gone to the Mexican restaurant with the giant margaritas a couple doors down.\", 'Amazing!! Everything was so good, the fried rice could have been better but other than that the food was great, we also had a Christmas roll and it definitely makes it on my top 10 favorite rolls!!', 'Nice location and good service. Food was average - steak was a little fatty but the fried rice and vegetables were very good.', 'I know this place as \"Something\\'s Fishy\" but I guess they changed the name. This place is good for cheap sushi but not the best sushi. I sat at the sushi bar and was greeted by a server after a few minutes. \\n\\nI got a miso soup, spicy tuna roll, and one of the rolls on special I think it was crunchy shrimp tempera roll. All of our rolls came out pretty quickly. We had to ask for water more then once and for our sides of spicy mayo. They weren\\'t busy at all when we came in but still took them awhile to bring us those two things. We also asked them for the check, which took us a while to get. \\n\\nOverall the sushi was very reasonably priced, all the fish tasted fresh, but the service wasn\\'t that great. I\\'ll probably come back here again since it was super cheap, but it wasn\\'t my favorite place that I\\'ve had sushi in town.', \"Super disappointed! We went last night with the Groupon and buyer beware- it's not a deal!! What they do with the Groupon is just subtract $35 from your total bill. However you also pay $35 for the Groupon. So there is no deal.\\n\\nFood: subpar. Shrimp got dry real quick. Steak was ok. Fried rice was super salty!! Veggies were good. We did not have sushi. \\n\\nService: no complaints. Except for the Groupon discrepancy. \\n\\nDrinks: $18 for a GLASS of wine! It was on the premium list but you can buy a bottle for the glass of wine that they serve. 2 glasses was almost $40!! This isn't the Bacara. \\n\\nUnfortunately as fun of a place as this is for kids I will not be going back it's not worth the money.\", 'We ordered a $ 35 dish, the hibachi lobster shrimp and fish, and it was definitely underwhelming', \"cheap sushi. it's good. a bit dirty looking though. the sushi is pretty quick if the place isn't jam packed with people.\\n they need some windows to be open. over all good sushi.\", \"I absolutely love this place! Super yummy food, and great prices. The staff has always been wonderful each time I've come in. The chefs are especially great!\", \"Called this place to check if they are open and the Asian manager said they were open until 9pm. When my party arrived they suddenly couldn't seat us.  Horrible service. I've been coming here for 12 years when they were called somethings fishy.  Guess I need to look for a new sushi place\", 'Quintessential tourist sushi: 100% farmed fish and chefs that could not identify Japan on a map. \\n\\nI did not think you could farm tuna but the chef said all their fish was farmed.  Another chef came out later and said the Tuna was wild-caught.  The manager then claimed the salmon was farmed but wild caught, though he could not explain what that meant. \\n\\nThe sushi tasted like sushi TV-dinner.  The experience had me feeling like an idiot for walking in a place that advertised \"1/2 price sushi all day long\"....I should have known.', \"Hibachi steakhouse has great options for to-go orders amidst the Covid-19 isolation and outbreak. They provide the same quality of food as they would for dine in. Who doesn't love take out sushi? They have great deals on seafood and have the best fried rice that can feed your whole family! I mean, $3 for fried rice and sushi rolls that are between $4-$15 are super reasonable when you don't want to cook or stress about not having produce at the store!\", \"This is a great spot to come alone or with friends. I was first introduced to this place for a friend birthday dinner! My favorite spot is at the sushi bar though! Hiro is extremely talented, and is always welcoming with a warming smile. I've tried every roll and my favorites are the fisherman's roll, Santa Barbara roll, tomsan roll and let's not forget the BK ROLL!\", \"This came out recently and it's been my go to ever since. So worth the wait. Although they are busy, they are very friendly. I love this place!\", \"Came here to celebrate my 6 month anniversary with my girlfriend.  Of course, on the drive there, i asked her to bust out Yelp...3 stars? boo.  But clearly yelp was wrong.  People need to realize that this place isnt about the sushi.  The Hibachi is where its at.  \\n\\nWe had a quick wait for not having made reservations, and we were seated at a table with 6 jersey-shore snobs who gave our poor waitress the toughest time ever.  We prayed that she wouldn't associate us with the other group and spit in our food.\\n\\nAll the fancy tricks were what I expected.  The flaming volcano, and the constant 'melodious' tapping of the spatula, salt, and pepper shakers.  \\n\\nNeedless to say, I had an amazing dinner.  The chef was courteous, funny, and knew how to work that skillet.  Its not the best I've had, but its worth having a visit.\", 'I remember this place when it was Something Fishy and feel like it just changed names. The location is what it really has going for it. \\n\\nThe only offer dinner options, I understand because of Covid but it is really lack luster and a little pricey for what you get. \\n\\nService was ok. Servers were really good but the owner (?) seemed to be a little overbearing.', 'My bf and I came to Santa Barbara for the weekend to celebrate his bday. We walked around the strip looking for ideas to have for dinner. We arrived at Hibachi about 30 minutes before closing and they still welcomed us and seated us. Our servers name was Omar, His energy was great! Omar gave exceptional customer services, he kept it very professional all while making us feel like friends! His energy was bright & cheerful. Even recommended a couple of places to visit. The food was also very great. The restaurant resembles Benihanas but way more reasonable in pricing. Only payed 80 something bucks for all the food ordered. This place is a must! I definitely recommend it.', \"This is a great sushi bar and restaurant located downtown. It's my go to for sushi. I usually get some gyoza too, which is also delicious. Good prices and service as well. Definitely recommend.\", \"This has been a go to sushi bar for everyone I know from Santa Bárbara to want to get together and enjoy hibachi (the wait can add up since they don't have many chefs)\\nBefore 7, you can usually find a spot at the sushi bar easy and get your sushi order instantly even for specialty rolls.\\nGreat prices and fresh pleasant rolls.\\nThe only thing that would need improvement would be the staff they're always being replaced because it's pretty inconsistent and unorganized but I usually just deal with the chefs at the bar and the two men have \\nalways been.\\nPs try the fried rice it's amazing.\", \"The sushi wasn't great, just OK. The half-price deal they have for sushi made it definitely worth it though. I'll be back for sure.\", \"Sushi and service are good.  They put all of the sushi from each sheet on same platter, so you have to only order several rolls per sheet.  Kinda dumb why they wouldn't think of that already.\", \"We had a 730 reservation, didn't get seated until 745 and didn't even have our drinks by 810.  We sat for over an hour before the chef finally arrived at the grill.  I ordered chicken teriyaki and steak and my chicken was handed to me about 5 mins before the chef got to the grill and was told that they couldn't cook chicken on the grill.  Ive been to many hibachi grills and all have cooked my terayiki chicken on the grill.  The waitress apologized and gave us a bottle of saki on the house but that still did not account for the bad service and experience from the start.\", \"I've been coming here since it was called Somethings Fishy. I was back in town for a friends wedding and felt the need to come back. I was hit with nostalgia and had the best time. We did sake bombs and had the best service. They were willing to teach us how to do the sake bomb chant accompanied by the banging of the tables, and they were willing to take all of our videos for Instagram with no complaints.\", 'Had a great meal for my dads 55th! Staff was attentive to our large group and always approached with a smile. Would recommend and come again! Loads of food for a good cost!', \"Worst restaurant in Santa Barbara. - local review \\n\\n\\nLast time we came here was a NIGHTMARE\\n- told to wait 30 mins for table\\n-50 mins later and multiple times checking in to see if we can get seated (empty tables everywhere)\\nWe were seated by the manager\\n- told we had to wait for the other party of 2 to show up... another 20 mins...\\n1 hour 40 mins later... we order...\\n- we get our water 10 mins later and salad 20 mins later 2hours and 10 mins later....we get our food order taken....the CHEF DOES NOT SHOW UP FOR 50 minutes ------- at this point the other party literally leaves- the manager runs after them( as we catch a waiter to ask where our chef is?!?!)\\n\\nThey bring us deep fried crap as a sorry and fresh nice fish to the people who ran out......are you freaking kidding me? (Also we don't eat fried food)\\n\\nThe couple was much older... so wE believe they also judged us by age..\\n\\nOur chef arrives and does not verify our orders, doesn't say hello or smile.... he seemed exhausted... \\n\\nMy salmon hibachi was raw and gummy and gross!!!\\n\\nSteak was good\\n\\nThe kicker!! They attempted to over charge us- when we had already paid!! Said we had to pay more!! I almost wanted to throw their fried tempura at them. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. \\n\\nAlso we had at least 5 different people come to refill our waters EVERY minutes!!! What is going on in this place?? Management is TERRIBLE!!!\"]   (0, 3456)\t0.14617001141359026\n",
